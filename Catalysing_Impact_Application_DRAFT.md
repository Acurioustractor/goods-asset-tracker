## Enterprise Structure

**For profit / Not-for-profit / Multi-entity or other:**

**Multi-entity or other**

**Structure description:**

A Curious Tractor Pty Ltd is a for-profit social enterprise operating Goods on Country as a core project. The enterprise uses a hybrid model: revenue-generating product sales (beds, washing machines) fund community benefit, with 40% of profits returning directly to First Nations artisan communities. We partner with DGR1-registered organisations (including Our Community Shed in Tennant Creek) for philanthropic funding, while building toward financial sustainability through commercial sales and social impact investment. This structure allows us to attract both philanthropic capital for R&D and community impact work, and commercial investment for scaling production and inventory.

---

## Enterprise Description (max 1000 characters)

Goods on Country manufactures durable, repairable essential goods for remote Australian communities - beds, washing machines, and refrigerators designed for harsh conditions and built from recycled plastic waste. We address a critical gap: standard goods cost 2-5x metro prices in remote communities, fail within months, and end up in landfill - while people sleep on floors and preventable diseases spread due to lack of washing facilities.

Our model is waste-to-wealth with community ownership. Every bed diverts 25kg of plastic from landfill. Products are co-designed with First Nations communities, manufactured using containerised on-country production facilities, and 40% of profits return to artisan communities. We've delivered 369+ beds and 20+ washing machines across 8 communities (Palm Island, Tennant Creek, Kalgoorlie, Maningrida, and others), with 200-350 additional beds requested.

Our audacious goal: make Goods beds as ubiquitous in remote Australia as a troop carrier or an Akubra hat.

## Community Voices

*The following quotes are from community members and partners across our project sites. These voices guide our work.*

### Fred Campbell | Oonchiumpa, Alice Springs
*Youth case worker and brother-in-law to the Bloomfield family*

> **"That's something Central Australia need — just something so simple, especially coming out of recycled, and is turning into something so unique for our mob in the bush or on the communities."**

On the beds addressing real need:
> "It's essential. The families right now, like you see in most of those houses that we went to, the beds were on the ground. It's a safety thing... a lot of snakes, so everyone wants to be off the ground."

On cultural fit:
> "In Aboriginal culture, we tend to move away from the places when there's a death in the family. They just chuck their swags on the ground. Now they know they can just chuck that in, take it out in the middle of the bush. That's pretty beneficial for them."

On youth employment pathways (describing Xavier, a young person they support, building beds):
> "He just was so proud showing them that he can build it. After that he felt so happy about himself... his energy was a lot more higher. He's quite capable of building that on his own and sharing that onto other kids."

On community enterprise potential:
> "I reckon there'd be, you know, like ourselves especially. But the young kids will be — they'd love to do that, you know, in the middle of the mall or something. You'll have a market here for sure."

### Jacqueline | Top Camp, Alice Springs
*Western Arrernte / Pertame woman, lifelong Alice Springs resident*

> **"From the waste, plastic. Perfect. That's really a perfect idea. Because it's very expensive buying bed — it's like three, four hundred. But with this here, it's so amazing. With just waste."**

On durability:
> "In the shops when they go and buy, it's easily to break 'cause it's too soft. But this here, it's look like it's really gonna stand like that, not break."

On community need:
> "It's 20... 20 or double. They like double. 'Cause we got a lot of medical issues with the back. This one will fix that. Their bed always giving them back problems."

On our approach:
> "To be honest, you are doing great. You are getting more better and better."

---

### Ivy | Palm Island, QLD

> **"Hardly anyone around the community has beds. When family comes to visit, people sleep on the floor."**

After receiving a Goods bed:
> "It's more better than laying around on the floors... It was easy to make. Yeah, it's nice."

---

### Alfred Johnson | Palm Island, QLD

> **"You can't just go down to the store and buy beds. It's a big muck-around. You have to bring them on the barge, pay for freight, and still, not everyone gets one."**

> "Having a bed is something you need; you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed. It's different than sleeping on the couch or the ground."

---

### Dianne Stokes | Tennant Creek, NT
*Waramungu and Warlmanpa Elder*

> **"Hardly any people around the community have beds."**

*Dianne received one of our first beds and came back within two weeks requesting twenty more for her community. She has been instrumental in refining bed designs around the fire with her family, and named our washing machine prototype "Pakkibnjalikari" in Waramungu language.*

---

### Chloe | Kalgoorlie, WA
*Aboriginal Homeless Fringe Support Worker*

> **"As a support worker here, I see how much proper bedding is needed in the community. So many people are sleeping on the floor or on old, unsuitable mattresses. Something as simple as a good bed makes a huge difference — it improves their health, helps with mobility, and gives them dignity."**

---

### Jessica Allardyce | Miwatj Health, East Arnhem

> **"Essential goods are difficult to get out as everything comes on a barge and they are expensive. There is also a lot of scabies and this often leads to Rheumatic Heart Disease, so washing machines are essential."**

## Intended Purpose of Investment/Funding in 2026 (max 1000 characters)

**2026 funding will scale community-based manufacturing and move us toward financial sustainability:**

**1. Production Scale-Up ($120,000)**
- 100 stretch beds for immediate deployment to requesting communities: $60,000
- Complete containerised on-country production facility: $60,000

**On-Country Production Facility:**
Our first-ever on-country production facility transforms community plastic waste into beds through a circular process:
- Plastic shredder processes bottle lids and plastic collected by community members
- Heated press moulds shredded plastic into waterproof sheets (180°C)
- Computer-controlled router cuts components
- Community members assemble flat-pack beds (5 minutes, no tools)
- Each bed uses 20kg of recycled plastic

**2. Washing Machine Expansion ($40,000)**
- 40 additional units for Tennant Creek and Maningrida deployment

**3. Working Capital ($50,000)**
- Inventory to enable commercial sales and faster community response
- Build toward 1,000-bed stock for revenue generation

**Total 2026 target: $210,000 in investment/repayable finance**

## Intended Funding Sources and How Catalysing Impact Grant Would Help (max 1000 characters)

**Current Funding Pipeline:**

**Confirmed/In Discussion:**
- Snow Foundation: $200,000 proposal pending (anchor partner, $193,785 received to date)
- The Funding Network: Relationship established ($130,000 raised September 2025)
- FRRR Backing the Future: $50,000 received
- Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation: $50,000 received

**Social Impact Investment (seeking in 2026):**
- SEFA (Social Enterprise Finance Australia): In discussion (Joel Bird, 23 communications)
- Snow Foundation Social Impact Loan: Offered access to this pathway
- Giant Leap (impact VC): Potential fit as we scale

**Government/Institutional:**
- Social Enterprise Development Initiative (SEDI)
- NT Aboriginal Investment grants
- Queensland First Nations Business Acceleration Program

**How Catalysing Impact Would Help:**
The Stage 2 grant would provide critical matching funds to unlock the SEFA social impact loan discussion. Having a reputable third party validate our investment-readiness significantly strengthens our position with impact investors who want to see co-investment. The advisory and mentoring support would help us navigate the transition from grant-dependent to investment-ready social enterprise.

## Confidence in Using Stage 2 Grant to Secure Additional/Matching Funding

**Very confident**

---

## Factors Influencing Confidence Level (max 2000 characters)

**1. Demonstrated Funder Traction:**
We have an exceptional track record of converting philanthropic relationships into sustained support. Snow Foundation has increased their investment across three consecutive grants (from $25K → $25K → $100K → $200K proposed). The Funding Network selected us as finalists and we raised $130,000 at a single pitch event - the largest single raise in Goods history. This demonstrates funders see both impact and potential.

**2. Strong Demand Signal:**
We have 200-350 beds requested from communities and health organisations - more demand than we can currently meet. Groote Eylandt alone wants 500 mattresses and 300 washing machines. This isn't speculative - these are documented requests from health workers, housing providers, and community leaders who've seen our products work. Diane Stokes received one bed and came back within two weeks requesting twenty more, offering to self-fund.

**3. Clear Path to Revenue:**
Unlike many social enterprises, we have a tangible product that generates revenue. Current production cost is $550-650 per bed; retail price is $850-1,200. At scale (1,000+ beds in inventory), we can achieve sustainable margins while maintaining the 40% community profit share. QIC has expressed interest in building 50 beds with staff for NAIDOC week - corporate engagement is viable.

**4. Asset-Based Model:**
Our production facility isn't a sunk cost - it's an asset. Palm Island Community Company saw our production video and said "we'll buy it." Communities may pay ~$5,000/week to host the facility, creating local jobs while producing products. This creates multiple revenue pathways beyond direct sales.

**5. Sector Alignment:**
We sit at the intersection of three funded priorities: circular economy/climate, First Nations economic development, and remote health infrastructure. Matching funds from Catalysing Impact would signal to impact investors (SEFA, Giant Leap) that we're investment-ready, not just grant-dependent.

**6. Team Credibility:**
Our co-founder Nicholas Marchesi OAM co-founded Orange Sky (2016 Young Australian of the Year, now serving 280+ shifts weekly). Funders trust his track record of scaling community impact.

## Capacity to Participate in Catalysing Impact Activities

**Yes**

We have the capacity to fully participate in Catalysing Impact's activities including induction, advisory, mentoring, and hackathon sessions. Both co-founders (Nicholas Marchesi and Benjamin Knight) can commit time to the program, and the $10,000 participation grant appropriately covers participation costs. Our work is highly compatible with collaborative learning environments - we regularly participate in advisory sessions, design sprints, and cross-sector convenings through our existing partnerships with Snow Foundation, Orange Sky, and others.

## Additional Notes

**The Stretch Bed - Our Core Innovation:**

The Stretch Bed is our next-evolution sleeping solution, designed through deep consultation with community members including Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla in Tennant Creek. Key features:

- **Completely washable** - The entire mattress can be put in a small washing machine, eliminating bed bugs and scabies
- **Made from 100% recycled plastic** - 20kg of plastic diverted from community waste per bed
- **Fully repairable** - Each component can be individually replaced
- **Body-adaptive comfort** - Innovative tension-weave technique creates natural flexibility
- **Lightweight and portable** - 12-16kg, 30% lighter than our Basket Bed
- **No tools required** - 5-minute assembly

**On-Country Production - A Circular Economy Model:**

Our first on-country production facility demonstrates how waste becomes wealth:

1. **Collection**: Community members collect bottle lids and plastic waste
2. **Shredding**: Amazing shredder processes plastic into raw material
3. **Pressing**: Shredded plastic goes into baking trays, heated at 180°C in a "sandwich toaster" press
4. **Cooling**: Sheets cool overnight to set properly
5. **Cutting**: Computer-controlled router cuts sheets into bed components
6. **Assembly**: Community members finish and assemble flat-pack beds

Each bed = 20kg recycled plastic. One container with shredder fills 200 tubs of processed plastic. Production container then builds 200 beds from that plastic. The same facility will produce washing machines and fridges using different molds.

**This is manufacturing that communities can own, operate, and profit from - not charity, but commerce with community at its heart.**
