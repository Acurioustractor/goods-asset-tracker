# Community Innovation: Beds, Washing Machines, and Orange Sky

> Community-led prototyping links local needs to practical manufacturing pathways.

## Story Summary

On Palm Island, community-led prototyping of beds and washing machines connected local needs directly to manufacturing solutions. What started as conversations about broken essentials became a practical pathway: identify what's needed, prototype with community input, test in real conditions, iterate. The link to Orange Sky's laundry service origins showed that simple, well-designed solutions for hygiene and dignity can scale when they're built with the people who use them.
