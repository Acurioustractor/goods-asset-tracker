# Ellen Friday: Still Waiting for a Fridge

> A damaged fridge after the storm highlights the health and dignity cost of broken essentials.

## Story Summary

After the storm, Ellen's damaged fridge became a symbol of the broader problem Goods on Country addresses: essential goods in remote communities break, and replacement pathways are slow, expensive, or non-existent. The health impact — food safety, dignity, daily life disruption — makes this more than an appliance issue. It's a health and equity issue that drives Goods' expansion into fridges as the next essential product line.
