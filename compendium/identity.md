# Goods on Country — Identity

> Community-owned manufacturing that turns waste into local value and protects health, dignity, and wellbeing.

## Purpose

Goods on Country exists because remote Indigenous communities deserve quality essential goods that actually last. The flagship Stretch Bed — made from recycled HDPE plastic, galvanised steel, and heavy-duty canvas — is designed for remote conditions: flat-packable, washable, repairable. The manufacturing process itself is designed for community ownership: collect plastic, shred, melt, press into bed components. The plant can move to community hands.

This is not charity furniture. This is social enterprise manufacturing where waste becomes value, communities become producers, and essential goods are built to last.

## Philosophy Alignment

| Principle | How It Shows Up |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Community authority comes first** | Products co-designed with communities. Manufacturing designed for local ownership. |
| **Build for handover** | Manufacturing plant designed to move to community ownership. Open-source bed designs. |
| **Make with lived experience** | Real roles in manufacturing, recycling, maintenance. Lived experience as core capability. |
| **Enterprise funds the commons** | Revenue from Stretch Bed sales funds community value and land care. |
| **Country sets the pace** | Products designed for remote conditions. We don't scale beyond community readiness. |

## LCAA in Practice

| Stage | How It Manifests |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Listen** | Community conversations about what essentials are needed. Field visits to understand conditions. |
| **Curiosity** | Prototype testing — Stretch Bed evolved from Basket Bed through community feedback. Washing machine trials. |
| **Action** | Manufacturing, QR asset tracking (389 assets across 8 communities), delivery and maintenance loops. |
| **Art** | Community-owned production. The plant itself becomes a community enterprise and expression of self-determination. |
