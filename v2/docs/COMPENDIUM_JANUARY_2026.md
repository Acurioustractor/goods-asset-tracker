## The Origin Story (Verified)

**How Goods Actually Began:**

The spark came in **2018** when Nicholas Marchesi attended a health conference where he heard Dr. Bo Remenyi (2018 NT Australian of the Year) speak about Rheumatic Heart Disease. Bo's message was clear: RHD is *entirely preventable* through good environmental health - yet she was filling out death certificates for children in remote communities dying from this disease.

This confronted Nicholas with the stark reality of disadvantage in remote Australia. Combined with his experience at Orange Sky (now serving a third of its operations in remote communities), where he witnessed people without beds, without working washing machines, and children with skin infections that cascade into RHD - it sparked the question: **What can we actually build that makes a difference?**

The answer became Goods: durable, repairable, community-designed "health hardware" (beds, washers, fridges) that addresses the environmental conditions driving preventable disease.

**Key Milestones:**
- **2018**: Nic hears Dr. Bo Remenyi speak about RHD prevention
- **2016-2020**: Orange Sky expands to remote communities (now 1/3 of services)
- **November 2022**: Goods project formally kicks off with advisory session (Alison Page, Corey Tutt, Nina Fitzgerald, Ben and Nic)
- **September 2023**: A Curious Tractor formally founded
- **2024-present**: Active bed pilots; 389 assets tracked in register
- **January 2026**: 15-20 stretch beds deployed with ~8 families; 200-350 bed requests pending

## The Team

### Nicholas Marchesi OAM
**Role**: Co-founder & Project Lead

**Background**: Social entrepreneur with 15+ years founding and scaling community-led ventures. Co-founded Orange Sky in 2014 (now 280+ shifts/week, 1.2M+ kg laundry, 207K+ hours of conversation). Led innovation including solar-powered vans and remote community expansion.

**Current Roles**:
- Founding Partner, Global Wash Alliance (2025)
- Director, Stanford Australia Foundation (2023)
- Caretaker, Black Cockatoo Valley (150-acre regeneration estate)

**Education**: Stanford Executive Program in Social Entrepreneurship (2020), Graduate AICD (2019)

**Honours**: Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM, 2020), Young Australian of the Year (2016, joint), Obama Foundation Leader: Asia-Pacific (2019), Forbes 30 Under 30 (2019), Westpac Social Change Fellow (2023)

**His Connection**:
> "Orange Sky taught me that dignity lives in the details. Clean clothes aren't just practical - they restore something essential. Dr. Bo Remenyi showed me what's at stake. RHD doesn't exist because medicine failed - it exists because housing and 'health hardware' failed."

### Benjamin Knight
**Role**: Co-founder & Technology

**Background**: Social change practitioner with 20+ years in community-led innovation. Experience spans youth refuges (2004-2006), Queensland Corrective Services in Gulf communities (2010-2014), QFCC Youth Advocate (2015-2016), Orange Sky (2016-2020), and AIME (2020-2023).

**Current Focus at A Curious Tractor**:
- Community storytelling across 4 communities (Quandamooka, Kalkadoon, Palm Island, Alice Springs)
- JusticeHub Digital Platform (launching 2026)
- Empathy Ledger ethical storytelling infrastructure
- Technology and operations

**His Connection**:
> "From 20 years on the frontline: we don't need better programs delivered to communities; we need better infrastructure owned by communities. AIME showed me what ownership looks like - stories must lead to community ownership and economic participation, not just awareness."

---

### How They Met
Ben and Nic met when Ben joined Orange Sky as Brand and Communication Manager in 2016. They worked together for four years, during which Orange Sky expanded into remote communities. They co-founded A Curious Tractor in **October 2022** as "a design lab and production studio for seeding imaginative and public-spirited ideas."

The name comes from Nic's farm at Black Cockatoo Valley - a tractor has a "power take-off" that provides drive to other implements. ACT brings the drive; communities take the keys.

## The Problem (With Sources)

### Statistics

| Claim | Source |
|-------|--------|
| **200-350 bed requests** pending from communities | Snow Foundation proposal, Jan 2026 |
| **$3M/year** washing machines sold → dumps | Alice Springs provider data |
| 59% of remote homes lack washing machines | FRRR, 2022 |
| Only 38% can wash regularly (power/detergent) | FRRR, 2022 |
| 1 in 3 children have scabies at any time | PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases |
| 1 in 2 children have skin sores (impetigo) | Medical Journal of Australia |
| Washing machines last 1-2 years (vs 10-15) | East Arnhem "Spin Project" |
| 55% of very remote First Nations homes overcrowded | AIHW, 2021 Census |
| 54.6% of very remote homes have major structural problems | AIHW |
| Mattress costs $1,200+ in remote (2x city) | AFSE application research |

### Demand Evidence (January 2026)

| Request | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Dianne Stokes** | Received one bed → within 2 weeks requested 20 more, offered to fund herself |
| **Norm Frank** | Called requesting 3 beds in maroon after daughter tried one |
| **Utopian Homelands** | Beds for every child (~$150,000 worth) |
| **Homeland Schools Company** | 65 beds for kids across Maningrida communities |
| **Four health organisations** | Reached out following 2024 forum (incl. Healthy Homes coordinators, OT workers) |
| **Groote Archipelago** | 500 mattresses, 300 washing machines requested from single community |

### Why Washing Machines Fail
From the East Arnhem "Spin Project" auditing ~500 homes:
- **Blocked pumps** (dirt/lint fills filters quickly)
- **Broken suspension rods** (40%+ of Simpson machines)
- **High cycle load** (2,300 cycles/year vs 200 typical)
- **Vermin damage** (mice, insects)
- **Incorrect installation** (wrong hose, not levelled)
- **No local repair access**

**Key finding**: Half of all faults could be fixed on the spot with basic servicing.

### Why People Sleep on Floors
1. **Overcrowding** - 55% of very remote First Nations homes
2. **Cost** - $1,200+ for mattress (2x city price)
3. **Freight** - "The freight is very, very dear"
4. **Products don't survive** - mould, dust, heavy use
5. **Housing quality** - 54.6% with major structural problems

**Important**: This is not a cultural choice. Community voices are unambiguous.

## Community Voices (15 Storytellers, 6 Communities)

### Palm Island (Bwgcolman Country)

**Ivy** (Community Member):
> "Hardly anyone around the community has beds. When family comes to visit, people sleep on the floor."

After receiving a bed:
> "It's more better than laying around on the floors... It was easy to make. Yeah, it's nice."

**Alfred Johnson** (Community Member):
> "You can't just go down to the store and buy beds. It's a big muck-around. You have to bring them on the barge, pay for freight, and still, not everyone gets one."

> "Having a bed is something you need; you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed. It's different than sleeping on the couch or the ground."

**Carmelita & Colette** (Community Members):
> "Sometimes family don't have extra mattresses. Kids sleep out with family or have to have their friends over."

**Jason** (Long-term Resident):
> "The beds are suitable for outdoor spaces and versatile in their use... Try the beds for yourselves and see the benefits firsthand."

---

### Tennant Creek (Wumpurrarni Country)

**Dianne Stokes** (Elder):
> "Hardly any people around the community have beds."

**Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla** (Traditional Owner, Weave Bed co-designer):
> "Imagine if you could weave a bed? Designing, iterating and learning with community."

---

### Kalgoorlie (Goldfields)

**Chloe** (Support Worker, Bega):
> "As a support worker here, I see how much proper bedding is needed in the community. So many people are sleeping on the floor or on old, unsuitable mattresses. Something as simple as a good bed makes a huge difference - it improves their health, helps with mobility, and gives them dignity."

**Gloria** (Elder, Dialysis Patient, Great-Grandmother):
Connects mattress quality directly to chronic disease management.

---

### Mt Isa (Kalkadoon Country)

**Tracy McCartney** (Support Worker):
> "The new mattress design is not just about comfort - it's about dignity and health. Lightweight, washable, and off the ground, it addresses real challenges people face living rough or moving between camps."

**Mark** (Community Member, tested bed):
> "It was easy to make - about five minutes to assemble."

---

### Gapuwiyak (East Arnhem, via Miwatj Health)

**Jessica Allardyce** (Miwatj Health):
> "Essential goods are difficult to get out as everything comes on a barge and they are expensive. There is also a lot of scabies and this often leads to Rheumatic Heart Disease, so washing machines are essential to be able to clean infected clothing, bedding and towels. This is the same problem across all East Arnhem communities and homelands."

---

### Groote Archipelago (via WHSAC)

**Simone Grimmond** (Request form):
> "We are on an island - literally. Therefore anything we purchase is so much more expensive due to freight."

**Scale of need**: 500 mattresses, 300 washing machines requested from a single community.

---

## Key Themes from Community

### 1. The Freight Tax
Every remote community pays a "remoteness premium":
- Palm Island: barge freight makes goods "very, very dear"
- Groote: no competitive pricing, costs inflated
- Gapuwiyak: "everything comes on a barge and they are expensive"

### 2. Health ↔ Bedding Connection
- **Scabies → Rheumatic Heart Disease** (Miwatj Health)
- **Cold ground → Pneumonia** (Kalgoorlie fringe camps)
- **Floor sleeping → Back problems, poor rest** (Palm Island elders)
- **Chronic disease management** (Gloria, dialysis patient)

### 3. Cultural Obligation & Family
Bedding needs spike during:
- Christmas and New Year - extended family visits
- Community events - football carnivals, funerals, ceremonies
- Seasonal movement - people between communities

### 4. Dignity, Safety, Belonging
> "Having a bed is something you need; you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed." - Alfred

> "It's about dignity and health." - Tracy

## Business Model

### Legal Structure
**Dual-entity social enterprise:**
- **A Kind Tractor Ltd** (ABN 50 001 350 152): Company Limited by Guarantee, ACNC registered charity, DGR status - receives tax-deductible donations
- **A Curious Tractor**: Trading company (Nic + Ben as equal shareholders via family trusts) - mission-locked trading arm

### Revenue Model
- **Philanthropy**: Funds R&D, community trips, subsidised deployment
- **Commercial sales**: Beds and washing machines sold to health services, housing programs, institutions
- **Community ownership (goal)**: Transfer manufacturing to community-owned enterprises

### Community Benefit Model
**Important clarification**: The "40% community share" was a placeholder concept, not a committed structure. The actual model is being co-designed with communities and may include:
- Community-owned enterprises (100% local profits)
- Employment and wages for manufacturing roles
- Equipment and infrastructure investment
- Training and skills transfer
- Hybrid models

**Philosophy**: "We don't license - we transfer. Communities receive full training, manufacturing capability, and documentation. They keep 100% of what they make and sell. Our goal is to become unnecessary."

## Five-Year Vision (2030)

### In Nic's Words
> "In five years time, our dream is to have the best products in the world made by and with the communities themselves. We want to not be seeing our washing machines ending up in landfill. We don't want to be seeing our fridges empty and not impacting the people that are purchasing them. Most importantly, we want to see people having amazing nights on beds that are appropriate for the communities."

### Success Metrics
1. **Product success**: Most desired, repairable, requested items - don't end up in landfill
2. **Community ownership**: Communities running production 3+ days/week without ACT
3. **Economic impact**: 30+ community members employed in manufacturing
4. **Health outcomes**: Measurable reductions in scabies, RHD, poor sleep
5. **Systemic change**: Open-source designs adopted by others, policy recognition

### Ultimate Success
> "When someone asks 'Who makes these?' and the answer is 'We do.'"

## Messaging Guidelines

### Words to USE
- "Working with" / "co-designing with" / "partnering"
- "Community members" / "families" / people's names
- "Communities lead" / "together we build"
- "Communities on country" / name the specific place

### Words to AVOID
- "Helping" / "charity" / "giving to" / "donating to"
- "Beneficiaries" / "recipients" / "the disadvantaged"
- "We provide" / "our program" / "intervention"
- "Empowering" (implies power wasn't already there)
- "Waste" as lead message

### The Litmus Test
*"Would this language feel respectful if I said it directly to Richard Cassidy, Norman Frank, or Dianne Stokes?"*

---

## Corrections to Previous Materials

### FALSE: "Linda Turner's 4-hour laundry trips"
This story cannot be verified. Replace with:
**Maningrida Laundry (Noeletta)**: Requested support to set up a permanent laundry facility. Existing laundry had broken machines. Goods providing 3-5 washing machines.

### INCORRECT: "Founded 2019, first deliveries 2020"
**Correct timeline**: Project formally kicked off November 2022. A Curious Tractor founded September 2023. Active deliveries 2024-present.

### MISLEADING: "$850 single bed, $1,100 double"
**Correct**: Basket Bed ~$350/unit. These prices may have been aspirational retail pricing, not actual costs.

### PLACEHOLDER: "40% community share"
**Correct**: Not a committed structure. Community benefit model is being co-designed and may take various forms.

### WRONG LANGUAGE: "Pakkimjalki Kari is Warlpiri"
**Correct**: It's Warumungu (the language of Tennant Creek, where Dianne Stokes is based).
