# Goods on Country — Knowledge Compendium

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Living Document
**Alignment:** LCAA, ALMA, OCAP
**Project Lead:** Nicholas Marchesi
**Total Funding Secured:** $550,000

## Overview

This compendium is the single source of truth for Goods on Country. It anchors all decisions in LCAA methodology and ALMA learning signals. It is a field guide, not a report—meant to be used in meetings, on Country, in code reviews, and in the quiet hours where decisions are made.

**One-liner:** Goods delivers comfort to Country through community-owned, circular economy beds and essential items.

**Audacious Goal:** Make Goods beds as ubiquitous in remote Australian communities as a troop carrier or an Akubra hat.

---

## Part 1: Identity and Intent

### Mission

To revolutionise how essential goods are created by transferring ownership of production and profits to First Nations communities through local resource utilisation.

### Vision

We envision a future where:

1. **Product Ubiquity** — Visit any remote community in Australia and you'll see a Goods bed, either in use or available for purchase. It becomes the product of first choice.

2. **Environmental Impact** — By creating highly desirable products, we slow the flood of cheap, disposable furniture into communities. When one Alice Springs provider sells $3 million of washing machines annually into communities — most ending up in dumps — we see the scale of the problem.

3. **Community Ownership** — 40% profit-sharing with communities, production facilities owned locally, jobs created on Country.

### LCAA Alignment

| Phase | Goods Expression |
|-------|------------------|
| **Listen** | 500+ minutes of community feedback, requests from health workers, community voice in every design iteration |
| **Curiosity** | V1-V4 prototypes, washing machine trials, material experiments with recycled plastic |
| **Action** | 389+ items delivered across 8 communities, operational asset tracking, v2 platform |
| **Art** | Community stories in Empathy Ledger, QR-linked bed journeys, impact visualisation |

### Principles Applied

1. **Country sets the pace** — We deliver to community readiness, not investor timelines
2. **Community authority comes first** — OCAP enforced in all data practices
3. **Identity before product** — We build relationships before beds
4. **Build for handover** — Local manufacturing training, community ownership model
5. **Make with lived experience** — 40% profit share, employment pathways
6. **Enterprise funds the commons** — Revenue supports community value, not extraction
7. **Evidence is story** — Empathy Ledger testimonials over surveillance metrics
8. **Tools create space** — Asset tracking reduces admin, increases transparency
9. **Share with care** — Consent-first storytelling, cultural sensitivity tagging
10. **Art returns us to Listen** — Stories flow back to inform next design cycle

## Part 4: Design Principles

### Core Philosophy

Three foundational design principles guide all Goods work:

#### 1. Respecting Country and Community
Circular design connecting environmental care with community benefit. Products that honour the land and the people.

#### 2. Community-Driven Construction
Built for local success. Co-designed with communities, not for them. Community voice in every decision.

#### 3. Place-Based Adaptation
Made for Country. Products adapted to specific conditions — heat, dust, humidity, remoteness.

### Product Design Framework

**Durability First:**
- Must withstand extreme weather
- Must survive overcrowded housing conditions
- Must be repairable locally
- Must last 10+ years

**Hygiene by Design:**
- Washable components
- Resistant to bed bugs
- Easy to clean
- Antimicrobial where possible

**Cultural Fit:**
- Works inside and outside
- Suitable for traditional living patterns
- Respects family structures
- Appropriate for ceremonial contexts

**Economic Reality:**
- Affordable for community budgets
- Valuable enough to respect
- Revenue-generating for communities

## Part 9: Production & Supply Chain

### Current Model (Phase 1)

**Centralised Production:**

*This compendium is a living document. It will never be finished. We add stories, prototypes, and learnings as we go. A good page helps someone act with care.*

*Like a tractor's power take-off, we transfer capacity to communities driving their own futures. We design for our own obsolescence.*

*— Aligned with LCAA, ALMA, OCAP*
