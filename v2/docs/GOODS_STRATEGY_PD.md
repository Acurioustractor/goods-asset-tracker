# Goods. Strategy Product Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Active - Ready for Review
**Project Lead:** Nicholas Marchesi
**Total Funding Secured:** $550,000

---

## Executive Summary

**Goods.** is a circular economy social enterprise co-designing essential products (beds, mattresses, washing machines) with remote First Nations communities while converting local waste into manufacturing inputs.

**Mission:** To revolutionise how essential goods are created by transferring ownership of production and profits to First Nations communities through local resource utilisation.

**Vision:** Make Goods beds as ubiquitous in remote Australian communities as a troop carrier or an Akubra hat.

### The Big Hairy Audacious Goal

We envision a future where:

1. **Product Ubiquity** — Visit any remote community in Australia and you'll see a Goods bed, either in use or available for purchase. It becomes the product of first choice.

2. **Environmental Impact** — By creating highly desirable products, we slow the flood of cheap, disposable furniture into communities. When one Alice Springs provider sells $3 million of washing machines annually into communities — most ending up in dumps — we see the scale of the problem.

3. **Community Ownership** — 40% profit-sharing with communities, production facilities owned locally, jobs created on Country.

## Part 3: Design Principles

### Core Philosophy

Three foundational design principles guide all Goods work:

#### 1. Respecting Country and Community
Circular design connecting environmental care with community benefit. Products that honour the land and the people.

#### 2. Community-Driven Construction
Built for local success. Co-designed with communities, not for them. Community voice in every decision.

#### 3. Place-Based Adaptation
Made for Country. Products adapted to specific conditions — heat, dust, humidity, remoteness.

### Product Design Framework

**Durability First:**
- Must withstand extreme weather
- Must survive overcrowded housing conditions
- Must be repairable locally
- Must last 10+ years

**Hygiene by Design:**
- Washable components
- Resistant to bed bugs

- Antimicrobial where possible

**Cultural Fit:**
- Works inside and outside
- Suitable for traditional living patterns
- Respects family structures
