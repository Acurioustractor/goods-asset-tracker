# Goods on Country - Content Compendium

> Waste-to-wealth manufacturing with community ownership.

## The Story

### Origin
Goods on Country emerged from a fundamental question: what if essential household items could be manufactured sustainably while creating economic opportunities for remote Aboriginal communities?

The work connects deeply with **Wilya Janta** ("Standing Strong"), founded in 2022 by **Norman Frank Jupurrurla** (Warumungu Elder, 2026 Australian of the Year nominee) and **Dr. Simon Quilty**. The need became clear when Dr. Quilty observed stark housing inequality - while he was given an architecturally designed house as a doctor, his neighbor Norman "was raising six kids in a tin shed" with no insulation.

### The Problem We're Solving
- **59%** of community homes lack washing machines
- **7 in 10** Aboriginal children contract scabies before their first birthday
- One Alice Springs provider sells **$3 million** worth of washing machines annually into remote communities - most end up in dumps within months
- Thousands of people sleep on the floor, thin mattresses, or share beds 3-4 to a frame

### Our Model
- **40%** of every sale returns to the communities where artisans live and work
- Community-owned manufacturing creates local jobs
- Circular economy diverts plastic from landfill
- Products designed FOR remote conditions BY community members

# Interview Questions for Story Refinement

> **Instructions**: Review each question and suggested answer. Mark with ✅ if correct, ❌ if wrong, or ✏️ if needs refinement. Add your corrections in the "Your Response" section.

---

## Section 1: Origin Story

### Q1.1: How did Goods on Country actually begin?
**Suggested Answer**: Goods emerged from observing the stark inequality in remote housing. Dr. Simon Quilty, working as a doctor in Tennant Creek, noticed he was given an architecturally designed house while his neighbor Norman Frank Jupurrurla "was raising six kids in a tin shed" with no insulation. This sparked the question: what if essential household items could be manufactured sustainably while creating economic opportunities?

**Your Response**: [ **Goods began when Nicholas Marchesi attended a health conference where he heard Dr. Bo Reményi speak about Rheumatic Heart Disease.** Bo's message was clear: RHD is _entirely preventable_ through good environmental health — yet she was filling out death certificates for children in remote communities dying from this disease.

This confronted Nicholas with the stark reality of disadvantage and marginalisation in remote Australia. Combined with his experience through Orange Sky (now serving a third of its operations in remote communities) where he witnessed people without beds, without working washing machines, and kids with skin infections that cascade into RHD — it sparked the question: **what can we actually build that makes a difference?**

The answer became Goods: durable, repairable, community-designed "health hardware" (beds, washers, fridges) that addresses the environmental conditions driving preventable disease.]
_________________________________

### Q1.2: What is your personal connection to this work? (For Nic)
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - How did you personally become involved? What drew you to community-led design? Was there a specific moment or experience?

**Your Response**: [**My connection to this work has three threads:**

1. **Orange Sky taught me that dignity lives in the details.** Clean clothes aren't just practical — they restore something essential. A third of our services are now in remote communities, where I saw people sleeping on floors, kids scratching scabies sores, families without working washing machines.
2. **Dr. Bo Reményi showed me what's at stake.** At a health conference, I heard her describe filling out death certificates for children dying from _preventable_ heart disease. RHD doesn't exist because medicine failed — it exists because housing and "health hardware" failed.
3. **Community-led design isn't a methodology — it's respect.** The most important thing Orange Sky built wasn't washing machines. It was six orange chairs where people could sit and be heard. Goods carries that forward: we don't design _for_ communities, we design _with_ them. ]
_________________________________

### Q1.3: What is your personal connection to this work? (For Ben)
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - Background in social enterprise and Indigenous partnerships, but what specifically led to Goods? Previous work experience?

**Your Response**: [ My connection to this work spans 20 years, but it crystallised through three experiences:

**First, frontline work showed me what's missing.** From 2004-2006, I worked in youth refuges in Armidale and Newcastle. Then from 2010-2014, I facilitated programs in Queensland prisons—primarily in remote communities across the Lower Gulf. I kept seeing the same thing: people cycling through systems because the basic infrastructure of life—a place to sleep, a way to wash—was either absent or designed without them.

**Then Orange Sky taught me who should be building.** Working alongside Nic from 2016-2020, documenting the dignity that happens around a washing machine, I saw how something as simple as clean clothes shifts not just hygiene, but connection. I also watched Nic's evolution after hearing Dr. Bo Reményi speak about preventable disease—and how that question landed differently because of what we'd both witnessed in remote communities.

**Finally, AIME showed me what ownership looks like.** Working with Indigenous methodologies from 2020-2023—story as evidence, community as authority, knowledge sovereignty—I learned that awareness without ownership changes nothing. Communities don't need better programs delivered _to_ them; they need better infrastructure owned _by_ them.

Goods is where these threads converge: the frontline evidence that basic goods matter, the Orange Sky lesson that dignity lives in the details, and the AIME principle that community ownership is the only path that works.

---

**Key quotes you can draw from:**

- _"We don't need better programs delivered to communities; we need better infrastructure owned by communities."_
- _"This 20-year journey consistently evolves: from witnessing resilience to learning that stories must lead to community ownership and economic participation, not just awareness."_]

### Q1.4: What is the relationship between Goods on Country and Wilya Janta?
**Suggested Answer**: Wilya Janta ("Standing Strong") was founded in 2022 by Norman Frank Jupurrurla and Dr. Simon Quilty. Goods on Country connects deeply with this work - but is the relationship formal? Is Goods a project of Wilya Janta, or a separate entity that collaborates?

**Your Response**: [remove this one for now - this need more approal and work to add ]
_________________________________

### Q1.5: When exactly did Goods on Country start?
**Suggested Answer**: The timeline suggests 2019 as founding, with first deliveries in 2020. Is this accurate? What happened in 2019 specifically?

**Your Response**: [ The suggested timeline of "2019 founding with first deliveries in 2020" doesn't appear to be accurate based on what's documented.

**The spark came in 2018** when Nic heard Dr. Bo Reményi (2018 NT Australian of the Year) speak about rheumatic heart disease being entirely preventable through good environmental health.[[1]](https://australianoftheyear.org.au/recipients/dr-bo-remenyi)

**Between 2016 and 2020**, while Nic was at Orange Sky, the organisation expanded into remote communities—now a third of their services. This is when he witnessed firsthand the conditions people were living in: inadequate sleeping arrangements, broken washing machines, the cascade of health consequences.

**The project formally kicked off in November 2022** with the first advisory session, bringing together Alison Page (National Aboriginal Design Agency), Corey Tutt (Deadly Science), Nina Fitzgerald (Going North Agency), and Ben and Nic.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-kick-off-session-24-11-2022-843b67c52f5144b6a00a20900de9cc75?pvs=21)

**A Curious Tractor was formally founded in September 2023**, with Goods as one of the core projects under its umbrella.[[3]](file://%7B%22source%22%3A%22attachment%3A8fdf3d76-8e09-4fec-a9ac-76450c3c785f%3ABenjamin_Knight_CV.pdf%22%2C%22permissionRecord%22%3A%7B%22table%22%3A%22block%22%2C%22id%22%3A%222b7ebcf9-81cf-8081-a8a2-f30cc77f4a1f%22%2C%22spaceId%22%3A%225496da29-0ded-443b-9f03-cf928ea15566%22%7D%7D)

**From 2024 to present**, active bed pilots have delivered approximately 400 beds across multiple communities.

---

**⚠️ Action needed:** If you've been stating "founded 2019, first deliveries 2020" in applications or materials, this needs verification. The earliest formal project documentation I can find is the November 2022 kick-off session. Do you have records of earlier activity that I haven't found?]

## Section 2: The Problem

### Q2.1: Where do the statistics come from?
**Suggested Answer**:
- "59% of homes lack washing machines" - Source?
- "7 in 10 children contract scabies" - Source?
- "$3M washing machines sold in Alice Springs" - Source?
- "60% scabies reduction" - Source?
- "$6 saved per $1 invested" - Source?

**Your Response**: [ **Question:** Where do the statistics come from?

**Answer:**

The statistics used in Goods on Country materials are drawn from peer-reviewed research, government health data, and documented pilot outcomes.

**Washing machine access:** 59% of remote Aboriginal community homes have no washing machine, and only 38% of residents can wash clothes and bedding regularly due to lack of power or detergent.

- _Source: Foundation for Rural & Regional Renewal (FRRR), 2022_

**Scabies prevalence:** Up to 1 in 3 children in remote Aboriginal communities have scabies at any one time — the third highest prevalence in the world. Almost 1 in 2 children have skin sores (impetigo) at any one time.

- _Source: PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases; Medical Journal of Australia_

**Washing machine waste:** One Alice Springs provider sells $3 million worth of washing machines annually into remote communities — most ending up in dumps within weeks.

- _Source: Local provider data, documented in Snow Foundation proposal_

**Laundry impact on health:** The Remote Laundries Project pilot in Barunga, NT recorded a 60% reduction in scabies cases following the installation of community laundry facilities.

### Q2.2: What specifically goes wrong with standard washing machines in remote communities?
**Suggested Answer**: Standard machines fail within months because they weren't designed for remote conditions - but what exactly fails? Dust? Power fluctuations? Hard water? Lack of repair access? Heavy use?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q2.2 — What Goes Wrong with Standard Washing Machines

**Question:** What specifically goes wrong with standard washing machines in remote communities?

**Answer:**

Standard washing machines last **1–2 years** in remote communities, compared to **10–15 years** in the general Australian population. The failures are well documented through the East Arnhem "Spin Project" — a household-by-household audit of nearly 500 homes.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Healthy-Communities-National-Aboriginal-and-Torres-Strait-Islander-Environmental-Health-Conference--19aebcf981cf80bb8202d5769530efab?pvs=21)

**Common failure modes:**

- **Blocked pumps** — filters quickly fill with dirt and lint, blocking the pump and preventing spinning or draining
- **Broken suspension rods** — found in over 40% of Simpson machines, causing violent shaking and repeated balance errors
- **Faulty lid locks**
- **Damaged electronic control boards**
- **Balancing issues**

**Contributing factors:**

- **High dirt loads** — red dust, sand, and debris from work clothes and bedding
- **High household occupancy** — machines run up to 2,300 cycles per year (vs ~200 in a typical Australian home)
- **Vermin** — mice and insects damage wiring and components
- **Incorrect installation** — machines not levelled, packaging not removed, wrong hose connected (many upgraded houses have only one tap, so the hot hose gets connected, causing failures when the machine tries to rinse with cold water)
- **No local repair access** — washing machines are considered outside the scope of housing maintenance, and there are no commercial repair services in most remote communities
- **Poorer quality machines** — cheaper Chinese-manufactured machines fail at nearly double the rate of better-quality brands, and are often abandoned within months

**The repair gap:**

When a machine breaks, it stays broken. There's no same-day repair call, no local technician, no spare parts. Households go weeks, months, or years without a working machine. The Spin Project found that **half of all faults could be fixed on the spot** with basic servicing — unblocking pumps, replacing suspension rods, reconnecting hoses — but without anyone to do it, machines end up in the dump.

**The cost gap:**

Machines cost **30–40% more** in remote communities than in urban centres. A washing machine that costs $700 in Melbourne might cost $1,000+ in Tennant Creek — and last a fraction of the time.

### Q2.3: Why do people sleep on floors or share beds?
**Suggested Answer**: Cost of delivery to remote areas, lack of retail access, furniture not surviving harsh conditions. Is there also a cultural component? Overcrowding? What's the full picture?

**Your Response**: [### Q2.3 — Why Do People Sleep on Floors or Share Beds

**Question:** Why do people sleep on floors or share beds in remote communities?

**Answer:**

This isn't a cultural choice — it's the result of compounding barriers that make beds difficult to get, keep, and replace.

**Overcrowding**

In very remote Australia, **55% of First Nations households are overcrowded** — only 45% of people live in appropriately sized housing.[[1]](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-welfare/indigenous-housing) When extended family visit for sorry business, ceremonies, or school holidays, there simply aren't enough beds. As one Palm Island resident explained: _"Sometimes family don't have extra mattresses... kids sleep out with family or have to have their friends over."_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Carmelita-Colette-1a6ebcf981cf8153978ed8ea7178e35f?pvs=21)

**Cost**

A mattress costs **$1,200 in remote areas — more than double the city price**. A washing machine: $2,800. A fridge: $1,300. These aren't luxury items, but for many families they're out of reach.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/AFSE-2026-Application-Nicholas-Marchesi-1060a7726dd146aba70c67b98e2c7c6f?pvs=21)

**Freight and logistics**

On Palm Island, everything comes on the Lucinda barge. _"The freight is very, very dear,"_ says Carmelita. _"You can't just go down to the store and buy beds. It's a big muck-around. You have to bring them on the barge, pay for freight, and still, not everyone gets one."_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Carmelita-Colette-1a6ebcf981cf8153978ed8ea7178e35f?pvs=21)

**Products don't survive**

Standard mattresses fail quickly in tropical heat and humidity — mould, dust, heavy use. In one Central Desert community, half of 22 houses had no proper bedding, and only one-third had working fridges.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/AFSE-2026-Application-Nicholas-Marchesi-1060a7726dd146aba70c67b98e2c7c6f?pvs=21)

**Housing quality**

**54.6% of homes in very remote areas have major structural problems.**[[1]](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-welfare/indigenous-housing) Houses are old, poorly maintained, and often lack basic infrastructure. As one ANU researcher described: _"Tenants pay rent for houses with no doors, no windows, and no insulation in the ceiling."_[[4]](https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/indigenous-communities-facing-housing-crisis)

**Not a cultural preference**

Some communal sleeping happens during family visits or cultural gatherings — but it's important to be clear: **people are not choosing to sleep on floors.** The community voices are unambiguous:

> _"Hardly anyone around the community has beds. When family comes to visit, people sleep on the floor."_ — Ivy, Palm Island[[5]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21)

> _"It's more better than laying around on the floors."_ — Ivy, after receiving a bed[[5]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21)

> _"We do need rest. It's for our health. And we can't afford it."_ — Carmelita, Palm Island[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Carmelita-Colette-1a6ebcf981cf8153978ed8ea7178e35f?pvs=21)

### Q2.4: What communities have you directly observed these problems in?
**Suggested Answer**: Palm Island, Tennant Creek, Alice Homelands, Maningrida, Kalgoorlie - can you describe specific moments or observations from each?

**Your Response**: [### Q2.4 — Communities Directly Observed

**Question:** What communities have you directly observed these problems in?

**Answer:**

Goods has spent extended time embedded in communities across remote Australia — not brief consultations, but multi-week residencies listening, learning, and participating in local protocols. Here's what we've seen and heard:

---

**Palm Island (QLD)**

Bwgcolman country, accessible only by boat or small plane from Townsville. Everything comes on the Lucinda barge — and the freight is "very, very dear."

> _"Hardly anyone around the community has beds. When family comes to visit, people sleep on the floor."_ — **Ivy**

> _"You can't just go down to the store and buy beds. It's a big muck-around. You have to bring them on the barge, pay for freight, and still, not everyone gets one."_ — **Alfred**

> _"Sometimes family don't have extra mattresses. Kids sleep out with family or have to have their friends over."_ — **Carmelita**

After receiving beds, the feedback shifted:

> _"It's more better than laying around on the floors… It was easy to make. Yeah, it's nice."_ — **Ivy**

> _"Having a bed is something you need; you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed. It's different than sleeping on the couch or the ground."_ — **Alfred**[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Myer-Application-Goods-154ebcf981cf80cd9b19f6514b0a1c6b?pvs=21)

---

**Tennant Creek (NT)**

Wumpurrarni country, in the heart of the Barkly region. One of the most under-resourced towns in Australia for essential goods.

> _"Hardly any people around the community have beds."_ — **Dianne Stokes, Elder**

We deployed five washing machines across households in Tennant Creek in partnership with Wilya Janta and Anyinginyi Health. The machines are being used daily. Dianne Stokes received one of the first units — positive feedback confirmed.

At a Healthy Homes workshop with Indigenous Eye Health Australia and Anyinginyi Health, we demoed and distributed Basket Beds. NT Health's Healthy Homes Coordinator followed up to explore ongoing collaboration.[[2]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/19bc438739db026f)

---

**Central Desert (NT)**

In one community we visited, we walked through 22 houses:

- **Half had no proper bedding**
- **Only one-third had working refrigerators**

This wasn't an exceptional community. It was typical of what we've seen across Central Australia.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/AFSE-2026-Application-Nicholas-Marchesi-1060a7726dd146aba70c67b98e2c7c6f?pvs=21)

---

**Kalgoorlie (WA)**

600km east of Perth, in the Goldfields. Fourteen tribal groups converge around this region, and many people live on the fringes of town.

> _"As a support worker here, I see how much proper bedding is needed in the community. So many people are sleeping on the floor or on old, unsuitable mattresses. Something as simple as a good bed makes a huge difference — it improves their health, helps with mobility, and gives them dignity."_ — **Chloe, support worker**

> _"The new mattress design is not just about comfort — it's about dignity and health. Lightweight, washable, and off the ground, it addresses real challenges people face living rough or moving between camps."_ — **Tracy McCartney, support worker**[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Myer-Application-Goods-154ebcf981cf80cd9b19f6514b0a1c6b?pvs=21)

---

**Mt Isa (QLD)**

Kalkadoon country. Ongoing collaborations with community leaders have resulted in co-designed bedding solutions addressing local challenges.

> _"You wouldn't believe how much something like a good bed can change things. Kids going to school, old people resting properly — it makes a big difference."_ — **Local health worker**[[4]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21)

---

**Gapuwiyak (East Arnhem, NT)**

Request received via Miwatj Health:

> _"Essential goods are difficult to get out as everything comes on a barge and they are expensive. There is also a lot of scabies and this often leads to Rheumatic Heart Disease, so washing machines are [urgently needed]."_

> — **Jessica Allardyce, Miwatj Health**[[5]](https://www.notion.so/2b5ebcf981cf810da468f0333fba5a7d?pvs=21)

## Section 3: The Team

### Q3.1: What is Nic's full background?
**Suggested Answer**: Leads Goods with commitment to community-led design, bridges manufacturing and community need. But what did he do before? What qualifications? What other projects?

**Your Response**: [**Question:** What is Nic's full background?

**Answer:**

Nicholas Marchesi is a social entrepreneur, designer, and public health advocate with over 15 years of experience founding and scaling community-led ventures.

**Orange Sky (2014–present)**

At 20, Nic co-founded Orange Sky with his best mate Lucas Patchett — the world's first free mobile laundry and shower service for people experiencing homelessness. What started in a van in Brisbane has grown into a national organisation operating 280+ shifts across 32 services each week in Australia and New Zealand. To date, Orange Sky has enabled:

- 1.2 million+ kg of laundry washed
- 12,700+ showers provided
- 207,000+ hours of non-judgemental conversation

Nic led innovation across the organisation — solar-powered vans, water-efficient machines, and the Orange Sky tech platform (which became Volaby). Today, a third of Orange Sky's services operate in remote communities — the direct experience that led to Goods.

**A Curious Tractor (2022–present)**

Co-founded with Ben Knight as a design lab and production studio for seeding imaginative, public-spirited ideas. Projects include Goods, Empathy Ledger, JusticeHub, and place-based work with First Nations communities across Australia.

**Other current roles:**

- **Founding Partner, Global Wash Alliance** (2025) — collective recognising laundry as a public health right; convened first gathering in Athens
- **Director, Stanford Australia Foundation** (2023) — supports scholarships for Australian NFP leaders to study at Stanford GSB
- **Caretaker, Black Cockatoo Valley** — steward of 150-acre regeneration estate on Jinibara Country (Sunshine Coast)

**Earlier experience:**

- **Camera Operator & Editor**, Seven Network / ABC (2011–2015)
- **Collaborator**, Carlo Ratti Associati / MIT Senseable City Lab (2012–2017) — design and communications on civic engagement projects
- **Vice President – Relationships**, OnlyT (2017–2021) — world's first t-shirt brewhouse and immersive design social venture

**Education:**

- **Stanford Executive Program in Social Entrepreneurship**, Stanford GSB (2020)
- **Graduate, Australian Institute of Company Directors** (2019)
- **Mastery of Business & Empathy**, Small Giants Academy (2023)

**Honours:**

- **Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM)** — 2020
- **Young Australian of the Year** (joint with Lucas Patchett) — 2016
- **Obama Foundation Leader: Asia-Pacific** — 2019
- **Forbes 30 Under 30** — 2019
- **Westpac Social Change Fellow** — 2023

**The thread:**

Nic's career follows a consistent line: dignity expressed through design. Orange Sky taught him that dignity lives in the details — a clean shirt, a warm shower, a conversation. Expanding into remote communities showed him the stakes when those details are missing. Goods is the next evolution: not just providing a service, but co-designing products that communities can own, repair, and eventually manufacture themselves.

### Q3.2: What is Ben's full background?
**Suggested Answer**: Design and technology expertise, social enterprise experience, Indigenous partnerships. What specific organizations? AIME connection (from photo path)? What role does technology play in the day-to-day?

**Your Response**: [**Question:** What is Ben's full background?

**Answer:**

Benjamin Knight is a social change practitioner, writer, and technologist with over 20 years' experience transforming systems through community-led innovation, deep listening, and Indigenous methodologies.

**Early Life & Education**

Ben grew up in Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley, NSW. He completed three Bachelor degrees in Social Science, Psychology, and Criminology (with Honours) at the University of New England in Armidale. His honours research focused on youth justice. A planned PhD will examine implementing the Diagrama rehabilitation model across different cultural contexts.

**Formative Experiences**

After university, Ben spent 3–4 years travelling and volunteering with disadvantaged communities across South America, South Korea, Turkey, and the Middle East. These experiences shaped his understanding of cultural nuances and the power of storytelling in driving social change.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2f0ebcf981cf803f9ad3def7b41e6e5d?pvs=21)

**Youth Justice & Corrections Work (2004–2016)**

- **Youth Refuge Coordinator** (2004–2006) — hands-on frontline work with at-risk young people
- **Queensland Corrective Services** (2010–2014) — Program Facilitator and Reintegration Support specialist working in Gulf communities
- **Queensland Family and Child Commission** (2015–2016) — Youth Advocate championing young voices in policy-making, including leading the **YJ: Your Justice** project amplifying voices of those working within the youth justice system[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Benjamin-Knight-Diagrama-5-year-plan-e35b8aef2e424c78895f5612ad2fdbd6?pvs=21)

**Orange Sky (2016–2020)**

Ben joined Orange Sky as **Brand and Communication Manager**, where he met Nic Marchesi. His role involved crafting compelling narratives and managing public relations for the organisation's growth. This work honed his skills in capturing and amplifying voices often left unheard.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Benjamin-Knight-Diagrama-5-year-plan-e35b8aef2e424c78895f5612ad2fdbd6?pvs=21)

**AIME (2020–2023)**

Ben worked with **Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience (AIME)** alongside founder Jack Manning Bancroft. His focus was on digital engagement and strategic growth — creating and leading programs that empower youth from marginalised communities. This is the AIME connection referenced in your files.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2f0ebcf981cf803f9ad3def7b41e6e5d?pvs=21)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Benjamin-Knight-Diagrama-5-year-plan-e35b8aef2e424c78895f5612ad2fdbd6?pvs=21)

**A Curious Tractor (2023–present)**

Co-founded with Nic Marchesi, ACT is an impact organisation working toward equitable and regenerative communities. Ben's core focus areas:[[3]](https://www.notion.so/CVs-NM-and-BK-2b7ebcf981cf8091a2bce129efbad06c?pvs=21)

_Community Storytelling & Strategic Support_

- Deep listening, learning, and strategic support across four key communities:
    - North Stradbroke Island (Quandamooka — MMEIC)
    - Mount Isa (Kalkadoon — CAMPFIRE youth justice alternatives)
    - Palm Island/Townsville (Palm Island Community Company)
    - Alice Springs (Oonchiumpa Consultancy cultural brokerage)
- Supporting Indigenous-led solutions through resource mobilisation and platform development
- Ensuring community ownership of all narratives and innovations

_Technology Role in Day-to-Day_

Ben brings technical expertise in digital platforms and AI ethics to ACT's operations:

- **JusticeHub Digital Platform** (launching 2026) — storytelling platform with community ownership and revenue-sharing; AI-assisted extraction with ethical safeguards where communities review and approve all content before publication
- **Empathy Ledger** — ethical storytelling infrastructure with Orange Sky
- **Notion/automation systems** — Ben manages ACT's command centre, pipelines, and operational technology
- **Website development** — strategic planning and infrastructure for partner organisations

**Other Projects**

- **ReKindle** (Founder) — rehabilitation program with strong Indigenous focus working with young people in Brisbane youth detention
- **BAIL Program** (Supporter) — Be An Indigenous Leader program in rural and remote Queensland
- **Contained** — immersive installation launching October 2025

**Core Philosophy**

Ben's approach is rooted in the belief that every story matters. His method centres on listening and learning before offering support — ensuring communities retain ownership of their narratives, strategies, and innovations. He describes his work as "empathy-driven innovation with a commitment to fostering creativity and connection."[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snowies-Snow-Entrepreneurs-Fellows-205ebcf981cf80c0b8c4c062d69b9e93?pvs=21)

### Q3.3: How did Nic and Ben meet/start working together?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT]

**Your Response**: [**The Meeting (2016)**

Ben and Nic met when Ben joined Orange Sky as **Brand and Communication Manager** in 2016. Ben had come from work in youth justice and corrective services, and brought storytelling and communications expertise to the rapidly growing organisation. Nic had co-founded Orange Sky with Lucas Patchett two years earlier, in 2014.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2f0ebcf981cf803f9ad3def7b41e6e5d?pvs=21)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Benjamin-Knight-Diagrama-5-year-plan-e35b8aef2e424c78895f5612ad2fdbd6?pvs=21)

They worked together at Orange Sky for four years (2016–2020), during which Orange Sky expanded significantly — including into remote communities, which would later become central to their shared work.

**The Spark for A Curious Tractor**

As Orange Sky grew, both Nic and Ben found themselves drawn to projects that didn't fit within Orange Sky's remit — particularly around youth justice, First Nations partnerships, art, and speculative design. As Nic describes it:

> "About two and a half years ago, Ben and I started A Curious Tractor... essentially it's a catchall for projects that I'm really passionate about that don't fit inside Orange Sky's remit. Mainly for a couple things: one is to protect Orange Sky's brand and mission, and the second is to have a vehicle to be able to explore."[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Katie-Meeting-TC-234ebcf981cf802f84f1d93e89dda1f8?pvs=21)

**Founding A Curious Tractor (October 2022)**

They formally co-founded A Curious Tractor in **October 2022** as "a design lab and production studio for seeding imaginative and public-spirited ideas."[[4]](https://www.notion.so/CV-Nicholas-Marchesi-OAM-d978a10e521b41b099fcf2b635f6c70c?pvs=21)

The name came from Nic's experience on his farm at Black Cockatoo Valley — he does much of his thinking while riding his tractor. The metaphor extends to ACT's philosophy: a tractor has a "power take-off" that provides drive to other implements. ACT brings the drive; communities take the keys.[[5]](https://www.notion.so/The-Buttery-Empathy-Ledger-246ebcf981cf809c9ee4cb6b52017e6b?pvs=21)[[6]](https://www.notion.so/ACT-business-set-up-204ebcf981cf80f4a3c9fb18b904b2cb?pvs=21)

**Complementary Skills**

The partnership brings together:

- **Nic:** Creative direction, community engagement, storytelling, product design, public profile
- **Ben:** Technology, operations, systems, Indigenous partnerships, strategic support

As one team description puts it: they "operate in the fertile space between visionary possibility and grounded action."[[7]](https://www.notion.so/Who-we-are-1d9ebcf981cf804cbf14e3cac67f8f96?pvs=21)

## Section 4: Community Partners

### Q4.1: Tell me more about Dianne Stokes
**Suggested Answer**: Community designer in Tennant Creek. Received first bed, came back requesting twenty more. Refines designs "around the fire with her family." How long have you worked with her? What specific design input has she provided? How did the relationship start?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q4.1 — Who is Dianne Stokes?

**Dianne Stokes** is a **Waramungu and Warlmanpa Elder** based in Jurnkkurakurr (Tennant Creek), and one of the Goods project's most important community design partners.

**Her Story:**

Twenty-three years ago, Dianne returned to her ancestral land with nothing but her car for shelter. She's been there ever since: _"Every time I go away from here, it's like it's calling me. Come back home."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Pitch-Final-25bebcf981cf8091b37ada835dd5f6b1?pvs=21)

**How the Relationship Started:**

Dr. Simon Quilty (Wilya Janta CEO) introduced Nicholas, Ben, Georgina Byron and Sally Grimsley-Ballard to Dianne in early 2025.[[2]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/1960fa188f639608) She's now listed alongside Patricia Frank, Norman Frank, and LT Stokes as core Traditional Owner partners in Tennant Creek.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snowies-Snow-Entrepreneurs-Fellows-205ebcf981cf80c0b8c4c062d69b9e93?pvs=21)

**Design Input She's Provided:**

- **Problem framing**: Identified that existing beds don't last, can't be cleaned, and make people sick. Washing machines cost 3-4x city prices, break quickly, and end up burned in community waste sites.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Pitch-Final-25bebcf981cf8091b37ada835dd5f6b1?pvs=21)
- **Bed design brief**: When asked _"How would you imagine a bed?"_ — she said something modular, off the ground, repairable, washable, and comfortable.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Pitch-Final-25bebcf981cf8091b37ada835dd5f6b1?pvs=21)
- **Design refinement**: Refines designs _"around the fire with her family"_ including Bam.[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Designing-and-cooking-around-the-fire-with-Dianne-Stokes-Bam-and-her-family-222ebcf981cf80ad8923e6dd5f874f36?pvs=21)
- **Unexpected insights**: When she saw the Basket Bed prototype, she didn't just see a bed — she saw furniture that reminded her of her youth, something that could become a couch for cultural programs.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Pitch-Final-25bebcf981cf8091b37ada835dd5f6b1?pvs=21)
- **Named the washing machine**: Gave the prototype washer its Waramungu name — _"Pakkibnjalikari"_ (washing machine).[[1]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Pitch-Final-25bebcf981cf8091b37ada835dd5f6b1?pvs=21)

**Her Guiding Philosophy:**

_"Working both ways — cultural side in white society and Indigenous society."_[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-x-Goods-Follow-Up-Questions-200ebcf981cf80da8a7ed8b48915d5f6?pvs=21)

**Impact:**

Multiple beds have been delivered to Dianne and her extended family (son, daughter Anne Maree, brother Stan, and neighbours). She's often quoted in pitches: _"Hardly any people around the community have beds."_[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)

**Future Vision:**

Dianne is developing plans for a cultural and youth centre on her land where _"kids who are in trouble with the police"_ can do homework and activities. Her business aspirations are being captured to share with funders.[[7]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-Fellowship-Application-205ebcf981cf807ca64ad30c1d4fd7b4?pvs=21)]

### Q4.2: What is the "deep roots model" with Oonchiumpa?
**Suggested Answer**: Long-term relationship built on trust. But concretely - how often do you meet? What does consultation look like? What decisions do they influence?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q4.2 — What is the "Deep Roots Model" with Oonchiumpa?

**The Concept:**

The "deep roots model" is ACT's approach to community partnership — _"place-based deep roots over wide reach."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Full-Moon-Council-November-2025-3bca6e9db0c14a949bc3d64736555edc?pvs=21) Rather than spreading thin across many communities, ACT invests deeply in fewer long-term relationships. Oonchiumpa in Central Australia and PICC on Palm Island are the two primary examples.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/ACT-2026-Synergetic-Harvest-Plan-23230ee41da14eaca3dcdf73565fc95a?pvs=21)

**Who is Oonchiumpa?**

- **100% Aboriginal owned and operated** consultancy founded by two pioneering families — the Bloomfields and Liddles — who were instrumental in setting up Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Review-1-1d4ebcf981cf8195b9f2fe8936a8672f?pvs=21)
- **Named after the Central Australian corkwood tree** (Oonchiumpa) — symbolizing resilience, nourishment, and connection to country[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Oonchiumpa-Brand-Style-Guides-1d4ebcf981cf805894f9f80f0b399cff?pvs=21)
- **Key people**: Kristy Bloomfield (Director), Tanya Turner (Manager/lawyer), Karen Liddle (Board Chair and Cultural Advisor)[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Overall-Strategy-1d4ebcf981cf8049a5e6ed4e48d23a62?pvs=21)
- **Core work**: Alternative Service Response (ASR) program supporting at-risk Aboriginal youth to _"live in two worlds"_ — Aboriginal identity and town life[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Core-overview-1d4ebcf981cf81968f3fdafd88004943?pvs=21)

**How Often Do They Meet?**

- ACT has committed to **6 trips per year** (monthly engagement) for Alice Springs relationship building[[7]](https://www.notion.so/Oonchiumpa-1d4ebcf981cf80a28c12e5c56d78de10?pvs=21)
- Email records show regular video catch-ups between Ben, Kristy, and Tanya[[8]](2226)

**What Does Consultation Look Like?**

⚠️ _The documentation doesn't clearly spell out ACT's specific consultation process with Oonchiumpa. However, the partnership includes:_

- Supporting Oonchiumpa's strategic planning and grant applications
- Building their website and communications materials[[9]](2227)
- Joint funding proposals (e.g., Paul Ramsay Foundation $500K application)[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Core-overview-1d4ebcf981cf81968f3fdafd88004943?pvs=21)
- Goods deployment planning through Alice Springs with "Oonchiumpa Bloomfield partnership"[[10]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-Foundation-Proposal-Q1-2026-Goods-Production-Scale-Up-7ce2d4e12ffa4c63b364622ab41f79d4?pvs=21)

**What Decisions Do They Influence?**

Oonchiumpa leads their own work. As Kristy Bloomfield states:

> _"We wanna be able to create space where people are invited to come to us, to seek what pathway we support this young person... We want to empower our traditional owners and our estate groups to stand up and talk freely and to be in a position to challenge government and to take the lead on many of our opportunities."_[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Overall-Strategy-1d4ebcf981cf8049a5e6ed4e48d23a62?pvs=21)

ACT's role is to **amplify and support** — not direct. Goods revenue has helped fund Oonchiumpa work,[[11]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-cdb0c934754c4cc6a35cdd343034fcd4?pvs=21) and ACT brings capacity support (storytelling, grant writing, tech) while Oonchiumpa holds cultural authority and community relationships.

---

**⚠️ Gap Identified:** The documentation doesn't clearly articulate the formal consultation structure, decision-making protocols, or frequency of strategic alignment meetings between ACT and Oonchiumpa. This might be worth documenting more explicitly for future Q&A.]
_________________________________

### Q4.3: What is Kristy Bloomfield's specific role?
**Suggested Answer**: Director of Oonchiumpa Consultancy, instrumental in community-led design approach. What exactly does she do? How does she bridge between Goods and communities?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q4.3 — What is Kristy Bloomfield's Specific Role?

**Identity:**

Kristy Bloomfield is a **Central Arrernte, Eastern Arrernte & Alyawarra woman** and **Traditional Owner of Mbantua (Alice Springs)**.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Content-Management-1d4ebcf981cf80bd9264cc5617517eee?pvs=21)

**Background:**

- **20 years in Aboriginal Legal Services** — worked at CAALAS (Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service) and ATSILS in Cairns[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Content-Management-1d4ebcf981cf80bd9264cc5617517eee?pvs=21)
- **2016**: Gave evidence at the **Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory** regarding her experience in child protection[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Content-Management-1d4ebcf981cf80bd9264cc5617517eee?pvs=21)
- Also serves as **Chairperson of Lhere Artepe Aboriginal Corporation**[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Oonchiumpa-Paul-Ramsey-500-000-Indigenous-Funding-1d4ebcf981cf8059a735c8c91863b02a?pvs=21)

**Role at Oonchiumpa:**

- **Director** of Oonchiumpa Consultancy and Services
- Makes all key decisions about staffing, funding, and operational activities[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Review-1-1d4ebcf981cf8195b9f2fe8936a8672f?pvs=21)
- Founded the organization alongside the Liddle family — two pioneering Aboriginal families who established the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service

**What She Does Day-to-Day:**

1. **Youth mentoring program** — engaging at-risk young people through Operation Luna referrals
2. **Cultural awareness training and Welcome to Country** delivery
3. **Cultural tourism** operations at Napa Homestead (family property)
4. **Government advocacy** — challenging systems while creating Aboriginal-led solutions
5. **Service coordination** — connecting young people to education, health, housing, and legal supports

**Her Philosophy:**

> _"Aboriginal culturally led programs are working and have worked. And I feel the government should let that be and let it continue to run those programs the way we are running the programs."_[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Core-overview-1d4ebcf981cf81968f3fdafd88004943?pvs=21)

> _"We are the experts on Aboriginal people. So we know the answers to the questions and we know what needs to be done. We just need to be given the opportunity to get out there and do it."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Content-Management-1d4ebcf981cf80bd9264cc5617517eee?pvs=21)

**How She Bridges Goods and Communities:**

⚠️ _The documentation doesn't explicitly detail the bridging mechanism, but here's what exists:_

- ACT's Snow Foundation proposal identifies Alice Springs production runs as _"likely... with Oonchiumpa Bloomfield partnership"_[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-Foundation-Proposal-Q1-2026-Goods-Production-Scale-Up-7ce2d4e12ffa4c63b364622ab41f79d4?pvs=21)
- Meeting notes reference _"Goods. Oonchiumpa and Mounty"_ coordination[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Oonchiumpa-and-Mounty-2bcebcf981cf808f8d54ea8b2312ff62?pvs=21)
- Goods revenue has helped fund Oonchiumpa work as part of ACT's portfolio support[[7]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-cdb0c934754c4cc6a35cdd343034fcd4?pvs=21)
- Knowledge-sharing around storytelling approaches (Kristy has shared content for Empathy Ledger)[[8]](https://www.notion.so/191ebcf981cf81b7a4bceb532dc8afeb?pvs=21)

**Gap Identified:** The specific mechanism for how Kristy/Oonchiumpa will participate in Goods production, distribution, or community engagement in Alice Springs isn't clearly documented. This could be worth clarifying.]

### Q4.4: How did the Norman Frank / Wilya Janta relationship develop?
**Suggested Answer**: Norman is Warumungu Elder, 2026 Australian of the Year nominee, co-founded Wilya Janta. What's his ongoing involvement with Goods specifically?

**Your Response**: [### Q4.4 — How did the Norman Frank / Wilya Janta relationship develop?

**Who is Norman Frank?**

**Norman Frank Jupurrurla** is a **Warumungu Law Man and Elder of the Barudu clan** in Tennant Creek.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Wilya-Janta-NT-Housing-4921cab56f0949728a1b07d4641cad96?pvs=21) He's the **Founder and co-founder of Wilya Janta**, a pioneering Aboriginal housing design consultancy.

### Q4.5: What is Snow Foundation funding specifically?
**Suggested Answer**: Q1 2026 production scale-up, supply chain development, community ownership model refinement. How much funding? What milestones? What's the relationship history?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q4.5 — What is Snow Foundation funding specifically?

**Question:** What is Snow Foundation funding specifically? How much funding? What milestones? What's the relationship history?

**Answer:**

#### Funding Overview

Snow Foundation has been Goods' anchor philanthropic partner since October 2024, providing approximately **$193,785 in confirmed funding** to date, with an additional **$200,000 proposal pending** for Q1 2026.

The funding began with an **initial $25,000 seed grant in October 2024**, followed by a second **$25,000 commitment in November 2024** that was dependent on project trajectory. In **June 2025**, Snow Foundation confirmed a major **$100,000 grant** to support beds, a washing machine prototype, training programs, and four community visits to Tennant Creek. A separate **$100,000 commitment for FY26 wages** supports Nic and Ben's time on the project.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snow-Letters-and-Update-206ebcf981cf80f0bc5cf39e5029522a?pvs=21)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-Foundation-x-Goods-Nov-Update-b3ff77a3312741cfb9f6cf6c50a67e77?pvs=21)

#### Relationship History

The partnership is characterised by deep trust and hands-on involvement. In November 2024, **Sally Grimsley-Ballard** (Partnerships Manager) and **Georgina Byron AM** (CEO) travelled with Nic and Ben to Tennant Creek. Sally described it as _"an incredible experience to engage with so many elders, traditional owners and community members and seize the opportunity to attend the Healthy Homes forum at Anyinginyi Health Corporation."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snow-Letters-and-Update-206ebcf981cf80f0bc5cf39e5029522a?pvs=21)

After the June 2025 grant, Georgina wrote: _"We loved seeing first-hand how impressed and grateful individuals and families were to receive the beds. It was exciting (and relieving) to see the community embrace the innovation and codesign opportunities... Good on you Ben!"_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snow-Letters-and-Update-206ebcf981cf80f0bc5cf39e5029522a?pvs=21)

By November 2025, Sally reflected in a check-in: _"Resoundingly, Goods is a standout project. So super thankful for your trust and investment."_[[3]](https://www.notion.so/TBC-Snow-Foundation-Goods-Check-In-2b9ebcf981cf808cb03bee329113e5cb?pvs=21)

#### FY25 Grant Breakdown ($100,000)

The June 2025 grant supported four focus areas: **Mattress V2 R&D** ($20,000) for washable, modular, and recycled components; **Washing Machine V1** ($20,000) to design and field-test a rugged machine for remote conditions; **Training & Employment** ($12,000) for culturally-appropriate resources and skills transfer; and **Community Engagement** ($48,000) for four intensive visits to Tennant Creek through 2025.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snow-Letters-and-Update-206ebcf981cf80f0bc5cf39e5029522a?pvs=21)

#### Deadly Heart Trek Collaboration (August 2025)

ACT joined the **Deadly Heart Trek** from August 5-15, 2025 — a Snow Foundation-supported medical screening initiative across remote NT communities. Over **800 children were screened** for rheumatic heart disease, resulting in **15 new diagnoses**. While doctors conducted screenings, ACT delivered beds to **Katherine West, Barunga (three communities), and the RHD medical team (five beds)**. An additional **90 beds** were supplied to Tennant Creek on August 5.[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-x-Goods-Check-In-video-edit-and-ET-257ebcf981cf812d86dbc98f2fdf5829?pvs=21)[[5]](https://www.notion.so/QIC-Follow-Ups-24cebcf981cf80fa92abd6baf0865563?pvs=21)[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Additional-Beds-Tennant-277ebcf981cf80da8465dfaeca3233bc?pvs=21)

Medical team feedback was positive: _"It was very exciting for the doctors and the people that were involved in that rheumatic heart disease screening... Your Beds and your infectious energy was wonderful for everybody to see."_[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-x-Goods-Check-In-video-edit-and-ET-257ebcf981cf812d86dbc98f2fdf5829?pvs=21)

After the Trek, Sally wrote: _"Gotta say – I feel so privileged to be working with you both, and so excited about the washing machine and the speed you are working. Congratulations. I think you are both incredible people and I am very grateful for what you are doing and where you are taking this Goods work!"_[[7]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/197dd588bde168a4)

#### Q1 2026 Proposal ($200,000)

The current proposal requests funding for production scale-up, supply chain development, community ownership model refinement, 40 additional washing machines, 300 additional beds, and wages for Nic and Ben to dedicate the majority of their time to the project.[[8]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-Foundation-Proposal-Q1-2026-Goods-Production-Scale-Up-7ce2d4e12ffa4c63b364622ab41f79d4?pvs=21)

#### The Funding Network Pitch (September 2025)

In addition to Snow Foundation, Goods was selected as a **finalist for The Funding Network's Healthy People, Healthy Planet event** in September 2025.[[9]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/198074a01c282fc2) Nic pitched at the live event in Sydney and raised **$130,000** — the largest single fundraising outcome for Goods outside of Snow Foundation.[[10]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Goods-238ebcf981cf80e99153c12d48160916?pvs=21) TFN funding went toward the on-country production facility, with actual costs exceeding $100,000.

#### Strategic Alignment

Snow Foundation's **Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) Strategy** directly connects with Goods — improving the environmental health conditions that cause preventable disease. The relationship operates on trust-based principles: _"Snow Foundation strongly believes that the provision of a Grant is part of a trusting relationship based on the shared aim of achieving the success of the Project... based on a strong level of trust, openness and mutual commitment in pursuing our shared objectives and overcoming obstacles together."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snow-Letters-and-Update-206ebcf981cf80f0bc5cf39e5029522a?pvs=21)

Sally remains the primary contact, and the foundation prefers informal updates: _"Please continue updating us — Zoom, face to face, WhatsApp or phone — we enjoy this and often find it more beneficial than written reports."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snow-Letters-and-Update-206ebcf981cf80f0bc5cf39e5029522a?pvs=21)

#### Key Contacts

**Sally Grimsley-Ballard** — Head of Partnerships (Our Country), primary contact

**Georgina Byron AM** — CEO

#### Other Confirmed Funders (for context)

Per the Snowies application, total confirmed income for Goods is $265,685: Snow Foundation ($193,785), AMP Spark ($21,900), and Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation ($50,000). Combined with the TFN raise ($130,000), total philanthropic support exceeds $395,000.[[11]](https://www.notion.so/Snowies-application-Snow-Financial-Reports-259ebcf981cf80789d70e7d5bf2c311f?pvs=21)

### Q4.6: What's happening with Purple House?
**Suggested Answer**: Exploring beds for renal patients in remote dialysis units. At what stage? Pilot? Conversation? Formal partnership?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q4.6 — What's happening with Purple House?

**Current Stage:** Early conversation / supportive relationship (not yet a formal partnership or pilot)

**What is Purple House?**

Purple House (Western Desert Nganampa Walytja Palyantjaku Tjutaku Aboriginal Corporation) is an Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation based in Alice Springs that delivers dialysis services across 20+ remote communities in NT, WA, and SA, plus mobile treatment via the "Purple Truck."[[1]](https://www.purplehouse.org.au/) Founded when Pintupi people raised over $1 million through painting to bring dialysis services to Country.[[2]](https://australian.museum/learn/first-nations/unfinished-business-extended-content/unfinished-business-the-purple-house/)

**Connection to Goods:**

- **Kate Clark** from Purple House has been working with **Dr. Simon Quilty** (Wilya Janta CEO) on comms strategy — this creates a pathway for collaboration[[3]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/196ad2b62b958ea7)
- Purple House described as "very supportive of the project" alongside Children's Ground and the Bloomfield family[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Red-Dust-Update-Goods-23bebcf981cf80449e6bd1da0d39b21e?pvs=21)
- The deep research notes identify Purple House as a model for how to engage communities authentically — their approach of having communities formally invite services is referenced as best practice[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Wilya-Janta-call-July-10th-22cebcf981cf80bbadfbf2f9e2fa1a19?pvs=21)

**Natural Fit:**

Purple House already addresses tangential needs for dialysis patients, including nutrition support and providing fridges for food storage.[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Deep-Research-Goods-1b1ebcf981cf806daeecdd2e055958ae?pvs=21) Beds for renal patients in remote dialysis units would align with their holistic approach to care.

**Status:**

A "Purple House x Goods" action page exists but is currently blank and marked "In progress"[[7]](https://www.notion.so/Purple-House-x-Goods-225ebcf981cf80078177c776a28673fe?pvs=21) — suggesting conversations have begun but no formal arrangement is in place yet.

---

**Short Answer for Q&A:**

> Purple House has been supportive of the Goods project and we're connected through Dr. Simon Quilty and Kate Clark (Purple House). Natural alignment exists — dialysis patients in remote communities need quality beds, and Purple House already provides holistic support including fridges for nutrition. Currently at **conversation stage** with potential to explore beds for renal patients in remote dialysis units. No formal partnership or pilot yet.]

### Q4.7: Who are Eb and Jarvin?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - You mentioned them as featured supporters but they're not in the current data.

**Your Response**: [**Question:** Who are Eb and Jahvan?

**Answer:**

Ebony (Eb) and Jahvan Oui are a father-son team from Palm Island who represent the future of on-country manufacturing for Goods.

**Jahvan Oui** is a young Bwgcolman man, born and raised on Palm Island. After graduating school, he returned home rather than staying in the city — "I was never a city boy." He tried an apprenticeship as a plumber, then joined the MinggaMingga Rangers working alongside Richard Cassidy and his father. His work includes checking pig traps, invasive weed management (particularly Lantana), controlled burn-offs, and coral spawn research at Heron Island.

Jahvan has a sophisticated understanding of how remote communities actually function — through kinship networks rather than transactional economics. "Everything gets around by word of mouth on Palm Island," he explains. "If I told my uncle I had washing machines, he'd call someone, tell someone, tell this person, that person." His insights into sharing economies are critical: "I don't think every household needs one, but a lot of people share."

In August 2025, Jahvan visited the Defy Design factory in Sydney — working the production line, handling recycled plastic sheets destined to become washing machine panels. The visit wasn't passive observation; it was future-CEO training. His quiet assessment: "Probably might see a factory like this on Palm one day."

**Ebony (Eb)** is Jahvan's father and has known Richard Cassidy since Jahvan was about 10. Eb was instrumental in the 7–8 year effort to establish the MinggaMingga Rangers program on Palm Island. He raised Jahvan with a worldview that prioritises connection over ownership: "Over here it's like, oh, if I help one person, that person gonna turn around and help me when I'm in need."

**Role in Goods:** Defy Design is working directly with Eb and Jahvan on the on-country production pathway — training the first generation of Palm Island manufacturers who will eventually own and operate local facilities.

**Key quote (Jahvan):** "There's too much rubbish. And if we get all that rubbish and recycle it, then there won't be any rubbish in the end... all that rubbish will get used for something good."

## Section 5: Products - Beds

### Q5.1: Why "The Greate Bed" name?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - Is there significance to the spelling "Greate"? Historical reference?

**Your Response**: [ **Q5.1 — Why "The Basket Bed" name? (And what happened to "The Greate Bed"?)**

**Question:** What's the story behind the bed names?

**Answer:**

The Goods bed went through a naming evolution that reflects the project's community-led design approach.

**Phase 1: "The Greate Bed" (early prototype)**

The original prototype was called "The Greate Bed" — a deliberate play on words:

- A pun on **"crates"** — the bed was built from repurposed plastic crates[[1]](https://www.notion.so/NM-Socials-Goods-115ebcf981cf80f790c7ef8f19567845?pvs=21)
- A nod to the famous **Great Bed of Ware** — an Elizabethan oak bed from ~1590, now in the V&A Museum, that Shakespeare referenced in _Twelfth Night_. Like the Great Bed of Ware, Goods beds were designed for communal use and legendary durability.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bed_of_Ware)

**Phase 2: "The Basket Bed" (advisory group pivot)**

Following insights and recommendations from the Goods Advisory Group, the name was changed to **"The Basket Bed."** The advisory group — which includes Corey Tutt OAM, Judith Meiklejohn, and community representatives — helped refine both the product and the language to better resonate with communities.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Advisory-group-call-231ebcf981cf80118b57e93d721229e9?pvs=21)

The "Basket Bed" name:

- Describes what communities actually see: a basket-like crate structure
- Is clearer and more accessible than the wordplay of "Greate"
- Aligns with the product's evolution (now over 150 deployed in Tennant Creek alone)

**Current product line:**

- **Basket Bed** — the crate-based original, now refined
- **Weave Bed** — newer design with woven material surface instead of foam/spring, born from community feedback that _"communities don't just want a bed, they want a MAD bed"_[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Introducing-Weave-Bed-229ebcf981cf80459c29df872b43a36e?pvs=21)
- **Stretch Bed** — latest iteration with canvas and recycled plastic frame]
_________________________________

### Q5.2: Walk me through how a bed is actually made
**Suggested Answer**: Recycled HDPE plastic processed into rope, combined with cane and hardwood frame. Hand-woven using traditional basket techniques. But who does each step? Where? How long does it take?

**Your Response**: [ **Q5.2 — How is a Goods bed actually made?**

**Question:** Walk me through how a bed is actually made. Who does each step? Where? How long does it take?

**Answer:**

There are two bed designs currently in production:

---

### 🧺 Basket Bed (simplest, most deployed)

**Components:**

- 16× collapsible plastic baskets
- 96× zip ties
- 2× washable toppers

**Process:**

1. **Sourcing:** Collapsible baskets and zip ties are purchased commercially. Toppers are custom-made — artist Nina Fitzgerald has developed culturally appropriate designs using traditional dyeing and screen printing techniques.
2. **Kit packing:** Components are flat-packed at ACT's base.
3. **Shipping:** Kits are sent via barge or freight to the community.
4. **Assembly:** Local "bed mechanics" (community members trained to assemble) build beds with recipients. No tools required.

**Assembly time:** Approximately 15–20 minutes per bed.

**Modular design:** Can be configured as single, double, or double-double depending on need.

---

### 🛏️ Stretch Bed (more durable, evolving design)

**Components:**

- Galvanised steel pipe frame (26.9mm outside diameter × 2.6mm wall thickness, 1950mm lengths)
- Heavy-duty Australian canvas
- Round ribbed tube end caps (27mm)
- Slot-together "T" section joinery — no screws or hardware required

**Suppliers:**

- Steel pipe sourced from DNA Steel Direct in Alice Springs (approximately $27 per bed)
- Canvas sourced from Centre Canvas in Alice Springs (approximately $93.50 per bed)

**Process:**

1. **Frame cutting:** Steel pipe is cut to length by the supplier.
2. **Frame assembly:** Pieces connect using "T" section slot-together joinery — no tools or fasteners needed.
3. **Canvas attachment:** Heavy-duty canvas is stretched across the frame and secured.
4. **Delivery & setup:** Beds are assembled on country with community members.

**Assembly time:** Approximately 30 minutes per bed.

---

### Who does what

**ACT team (Nic and Ben):** Design, coordination, sourcing, and delivery logistics.

**DNA Steel Direct and Centre Canvas (Alice Springs):** Supply the steel pipe and canvas materials.

**ACT team and logistics partners:** Kit assembly and delivery to communities.

**Community "bed mechanics":** Trained local people who assemble beds on country with recipients.

**Nina Fitzgerald:** Creates culturally appropriate topper designs using traditional techniques.

---

### Future vision

On-country production facilities are planned for Tennant Creek, Alice Springs, and Palm Island. Community members — including Jahvan Oui on Palm Island — will manufacture beds locally, potentially incorporating recycled plastic components made from community waste.

---

_Note: The Weave Bed design (canvas woven through 45-degree slots with ratchet strap tensioning) was tested but has been discontinued._]
_________________________________

### Q5.3: What makes the Stretch Bed different from the Greate Bed?
**Suggested Answer**: 30% lighter, uses tension-weave technique, body-adaptive. Why did you develop a second bed type? What feedback led to it?

**Your Response**: [**Q5.3 — What makes the Stretch Bed different from the Basket Bed?**

**Question:** What makes the Stretch Bed different from the Basket Bed? Why did you develop a second bed type? What feedback led to it?

**Answer:**

The Stretch Bed is the third iteration of Goods bed design, developed directly from community feedback on the Basket Bed.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Rachel-2caebcf981cf80aaa22bd8f00abf77bf?pvs=21)

---

### Key differences

**Basket Bed:**

- Collapsible plastic baskets + zip ties + foam toppers
- Rigid structure
- Foam topper can't be fully washed (breaks down in washing machine)
- Quick assembly, no tools

**Stretch Bed:**

- Galvanised steel pipe frame + heavy-duty canvas
- Tension-based sleep surface (like a catamaran trampoline)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Mad-Bed-x-LaceBed-x-Bed-v2-20cebcf981cf800b8733d5bf28077db2?pvs=21)
- **No foam** — entire bed can be hosed down or left outside
- Flat-packs smaller, lighter, more portable

---

### Community feedback that drove the redesign

From testing Basket Beds in Tennant Creek and Palm Island, four consistent themes emerged:[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Rachel-2caebcf981cf80aaa22bd8f00abf77bf?pvs=21)[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Advisory-Group-Check-in-254ebcf981cf81df97d6f88bdad3709e?pvs=21)

1. **"We want to move it around"** — People wanted beds light enough to shift between rooms or take camping. The Stretch Bed flat-packs to "about this big" and is significantly lighter.
2. **"We want it high off the ground"** — Both designs achieve this, but the Stretch Bed's frame is more stable for larger households.
3. **"We don't want the foam"** — The foam toppers on Basket Beds couldn't be properly washed — they broke down in washing machines. Communities wanted beds that could be fully cleaned to address scabies and bedbugs. The Stretch Bed's canvas surface can be hosed down or left outside in the weather.[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Rachel-2caebcf981cf80aaa22bd8f00abf77bf?pvs=21)
4. **"We want a MAD bed"** — Advisor Shaun Fisher's challenge: "Communities don't just want another bed, they want a MAD bed!" This pushed the team toward a more innovative, body-adaptive design.[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Introducing-Weave-Bed-229ebcf981cf80459c29df872b43a36e?pvs=21)

---

### Design improvements

- **Tension-weave technique:** Canvas stretched across frame creates a breathable, body-adaptive surface — similar to a catamaran trampoline or tennis racket stringing[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Mad-Bed-x-LaceBed-x-Bed-v2-20cebcf981cf800b8733d5bf28077db2?pvs=21)
- **Fully washable:** No foam means no moisture retention, no mould, no breakdown
- **Flat-packable:** Smaller shipping footprint, easier logistics to remote communities
- **Outdoor-ready:** Can stay outside, handles weather, won't rust (canvas + galvanised steel)
- **On-country production potential:** Recycled HDPE panels and canvas can be made locally[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Rachel-2caebcf981cf80aaa22bd8f00abf77bf?pvs=21)

---

### Community verdict

_"These ones are the best so far... in terms of flexibility, ease of use and reduction in skin disease stuff."_[[7]](https://www.notion.so/Rachel-2caebcf981cf80aaa22bd8f00abf77bf?pvs=21)

### Q5.4: Where does the recycled plastic come from?
**Suggested Answer**: "Collected from communities and recycling programs" - which communities? Which programs? What type of plastic specifically? Who processes it?

**Your Response**: [ **Q5.4 — Where does the recycled plastic come from?**

**Question:** Where does the recycled plastic come from? Which communities? Which programs? What type of plastic specifically? Who processes it?

**Answer:**

### Current practice

**Plastic type:** HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) — selected for its durability, stain resistance, UV resistance, and ability to be fully washed. Unlike painted surfaces that trap dirt, HDPE stays clean in harsh conditions.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Defy-x-Goods-TC-Debrief-256ebcf981cf803fb71df87b60085f1b?pvs=21)

**Processor:** Defy Design, a recycled plastic design studio and manufacturer based in Botany, Sydney. They've been operating for 5 years, transforming plastic waste into products including HDPE panels, furniture, and interiors. Capabilities include injection moulding, compression moulding, and sheet material with CNC routing.[[2]](https://www.defydesign.org/)

**Current sourcing:** Defy Design sources HDPE through their established recycling supply chains and partnerships with Sydney businesses. Quality control is critical: even 20% contamination ruins an entire panel, so starting with controlled material ensures product reliability.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Defy-x-Goods-TC-Debrief-256ebcf981cf803fb71df87b60085f1b?pvs=21)

### Future vision: On-country collection

The long-term goal is community-based collection and processing through a staged approach:[[3]](https://www.notion.so/2c6ebcf981cf808db84ce97cb511a47e?pvs=21)

1. **Collection:** Paid jobs for gathering plastic from households, old appliances, cars, construction waste, and marine debris
2. **Washing and sorting:** Community quality control stations
3. **Shredding:** On-country shredders processing cleaned HDPE
4. **Fabrication:** Mobile pressing and routing equipment to create panels locally

**Target communities:** Palm Island (Jahvan Oui training with Defy), Tennant Creek (Junior involved in builds), and Gulf of Carpentaria region (massive marine debris — 6 tonnes removed in 5km, 90% plastic).[[4]](https://www.notion.so/History-links-notes-547e06ffbc9d4eed96bb2f480f345270?pvs=21)[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Defy-Sydney-trip-story-Eb-and-Jahvan-265ebcf981cf80a2b9abeb95d25ea9b3?pvs=21)

**Production model:** One container with shredder fills 200 tubs; production container builds 200 beds from that plastic.[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-Foundation-Proposal-Q1-2026-Goods-Production-Scale-Up-7ce2d4e12ffa4c63b364622ab41f79d4?pvs=21)

---

### Key correction to suggested answer

The statement "collected from communities and recycling programs" is the **vision**, not current practice. Currently, recycled HDPE comes from Defy Design's Sydney-based recycling operations. Community-sourced plastic is the goal once quality control infrastructure is in place.]
_________________________________

### Q5.5: Who are the artisans making the beds?
**Suggested Answer**: Community members trained in construction. Where are they based? How many? Are they paid employees, contractors, community members?

**Your Response**: [ **Question:** Who makes the beds? Where are they based? How many? Are they paid employees, contractors, community members?

**Answer:**

### Current model

**ACT team (Nic and Ben):** Currently lead most builds, travelling to communities with materials and building alongside community members.

**Community "bed mechanics":** Local people who learn to assemble beds during build trips. Not employees — participants who build their own beds and help neighbours. Examples include:

- **Junior** (Tennant Creek) — helped build ~150 beds, potential future enterprise operator[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Advisory-group-call-231ebcf981cf80118b57e93d721229e9?pvs=21)
- **Jahvan Oui** (Palm Island) — training with Defy Design, visited Sydney factory to learn panel fabrication[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Defy-Sydney-trip-story-Eb-and-Jahvan-265ebcf981cf80a2b9abeb95d25ea9b3?pvs=21)

**Defy Design (Sydney):** Manufacture HDPE panels and provide technical training for on-country production.

---

### Future model: Community-owned enterprise

The goal is **not** to create artisan craftspeople dependent on ACT — it's to establish **community-owned businesses** that manufacture, sell, and maintain beds and washing machines independently.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/2c6ebcf981cf808db84ce97cb511a47e?pvs=21)

**Enterprise structure:**

- Community members run collection, manufacturing, sales, and maintenance
- ACT provides initial training, equipment, and design support — then steps back
- Revenue stays in community

**Potential roles (paid employment within community enterprise):**

- Plastic collection and sorting
- Shredding and quality control
- Panel fabrication (cutting, routing, finishing)
- Bed and washing machine assembly
- Sales and distribution
- Maintenance and repair ("bed mechanics" / "washing machine technicians")

**Target communities for enterprise pilots:**

- Palm Island (Jahvan leading)
- Tennant Creek (Junior leading)
- Alice Springs (potential hub)

---

### Key reframe

This isn't about "artisans" making handcrafted products. It's about building **community capacity to own and operate manufacturing enterprises** — with beds and washing machines as the first products. ACT's role is to prove the model works, then transfer ownership so communities run it themselves.

_"The big dream is that the community is building, running, and maintaining these products... the maintenance, the sales, the end-of-life management, the washing, can be done by the community."_[[3]](https://www.notion.so/2c6ebcf981cf808db84ce97cb511a47e?pvs=21)]
_________________________________

### Q5.6: How does the 40% community share actually work?
**Suggested Answer**: 40% returns to communities where artisans live and work. Is this 40% of revenue or profit? Who receives it? Cash, investment, equipment?

**Your Response**: [ **Q5.6 — How does the community benefit model work?**

**Question:** How do communities benefit financially from Goods? Is there a specific revenue share? Who receives it? How?

**Answer:**

### Honest answer: We're still figuring this out

There is **no fixed percentage or predetermined model** for community financial benefit. The "40% community share" mentioned in some early materials was a placeholder concept, not a committed structure.

We are actively working with communities to design a model that:

- Makes sense for how they want to operate
- Reflects their priorities (cash income, equipment, training, enterprise ownership)
- Can actually be implemented and sustained

---

### Principles guiding the model

**Community ownership over charity:** The goal is for communities to own and operate manufacturing enterprises — not to receive a cut of someone else's business.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2c6ebcf981cf808db84ce97cb511a47e?pvs=21)

**Co-design, not top-down:** We're getting feedback from Palm Island, Tennant Creek, and other communities about what would actually work for them. Different communities may want different arrangements.

**Options being explored:**

- Community-owned enterprises that manufacture and sell directly (100% community revenue)
- Employment and wages for collection, manufacturing, sales, and maintenance roles
- Equipment and infrastructure investment (shredders, tools, workshop spaces)
- Training and skills transfer
- Hybrid models combining several of these

---

### What we know so far

Communities have told us they value:

- **Paid work** — jobs for collecting, building, maintaining
- **Ownership** — running their own business, not being dependent
- **Flexibility** — different arrangements for different contexts
- **Practical support** — equipment, training, connections — not just cash

---

### Why we're not committing to a specific number

Locking in a percentage before understanding how community enterprises will actually operate would be putting the cart before the horse. The model needs to emerge from:

- What communities actually want
- What's financially sustainable
- What creates genuine self-determination (not ongoing dependency)

We'd rather be honest that this is a work in progress than make promises we can't keep.]

## Section 6: Products - Washing Machines

### Q6.1: Who named it "Pakkimjalki Kari" and why?
**Suggested Answer**: Warlpiri language for "washing machine." Who suggested this? What community? Is there a story behind it?

**Your Response**: [ **Q6.1 — Who named it "Pakkimjalki Kari" and why?**

**Question:** Who suggested this name? What community? What language? Is there a story behind it?

**Answer:**

### The name

**Pakkimjalki Kari** — Warumungu language for "washing machine"[[1]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Pitch-Final-25bebcf981cf8091b37ada835dd5f6b1?pvs=21)

_(Note: The suggested answer says "Warlpiri" but it's actually Warumungu — the language of Tennant Creek)_

### Who named it

**Dianne Stokes** named the washing machine, with approval from **Patricia Frank** and **Norman Frank** (Warumungu Elders).[[2]](https://www.notion.so/NM-Tennant-Creek-Jurnkkurakurr-Visit-May-1f2ebcf981cf805989d0fbd60bbadc60?pvs=21)

### Community

**Tennant Creek (Jurnkkurakurr)** — Warumungu Country

### The story

During a May 2025 trip to Tennant Creek, Nic and Ben asked community Elders what the products should be called in language. Patricia, Norman, and Dianne approved two names:[[2]](https://www.notion.so/NM-Tennant-Creek-Jurnkkurakurr-Visit-May-1f2ebcf981cf805989d0fbd60bbadc60?pvs=21)

1. **Pakkimjalki kari** — washing machine
2. **Jana ngunjalki kari** — bed to sleep on

The naming represents community ownership of the project — these aren't products being done _to_ community, they're products being named, designed, and built _by_ community.

As described in the TFN pitch: _"Here's Dianne's latest creation: an indestructible washing machine she named 'Pakkimjalki Kari' — Warumungu for washing machine. Designed and made by her community, it's simple, repairable, has one button, and is made from 56 kilograms of recycled plastic waste."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-Pitch-Final-25bebcf981cf8091b37ada835dd5f6b1?pvs=21)

---

### Key correction to suggested answer

The language is **Warumungu**, not Warlpiri. Both are Central Australian languages, but Warumungu is the language of Tennant Creek where Dianne, Patricia, and Norman are based.]

### Q6.2: Tell me Linda Turner's full story
**Suggested Answer**: Before getting her washing machine in Maningrida, washing clothes meant a 4-hour round trip to town. What's her life like now? Can we quote her directly?

**Your Response**: [thsi is a flase torsey plese use this in its place ### Option C: Maningrida Laundry (Noeletta) — Community facility

Noeletta requested support to set up a permanent laundry facility in Maningrida. The existing laundry had several broken washing machines and dryers. Goods is providing 3-5 washing machines for this community facility.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-catch-up-Goods-June-17-215ebcf981cf809f94fde8e50917d7ef?pvs=21)

This is a real Maningrida story, though it's about a community laundry, not an individual named Linda Turner.]
_________________________________

### Q6.3: What makes these washing machines different from store-bought?
**Suggested Answer**: Built for remote conditions, common parts, community members can replace themselves, solar-compatible. Specifically - what brand/model base? What modifications?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q6.3 — What makes these washing machines different from store-bought?

**Base machine:** Speed Queen AWNA62 top-loader[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Parts-Digram-1b6ebcf981cf802aa574f1657b436400?pvs=21)

**Why this model:**

- Speed Queen holds 70% of commercial washing machine applications in Australia[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Red-Dust-Update-Goods-23bebcf981cf80449e6bd1da0d39b21e?pvs=21)
- Built for commercial use (laundromats, hotels) so already designed for heavy daily loads
- Mechanical controls instead of electronics that can fail
- 5-year parts and labour warranty
- Stainless steel wash tub, 8.5kg capacity[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Parts-Digram-1b6ebcf981cf802aa574f1657b436400?pvs=21)

**Modifications ("What a bull bar is to a four-wheel drive"):**[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Red-Dust-Update-Goods-23bebcf981cf80449e6bd1da0d39b21e?pvs=21)

- **Wrapped in recycled plastic case** — Protects from kicks, drops, and damage. The casing is made from recycled plastic collected on-country.[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-advisory-group-meeting-17-June-215ebcf981cf8025b467cd6591cc6873?pvs=21)
- **Reduced to ONE button** — Communities said "we don't know what all these buttons mean," so all complexity was removed.[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Smash-the-glass-on-the-top-of-it-or-you-know-we-ve-removed-all-the-buttons-because-everyone-was-li-246ebcf981cf805cb234cffc7423c0f4?pvs=21)
- **Glass top protected or removed** — Prevents smashing.
- **Customisable language panel** — The front cassette can be swapped community to community with local language (e.g., _Pakkimjalki kari_ in Warumungu).[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-advisory-group-meeting-17-June-215ebcf981cf8025b467cd6591cc6873?pvs=21)
- **Built-in telemetry monitoring** — GPS tracking plus power consumption monitoring. The system knows when the machine is being used, when it breaks, and which cycle it's stuck on — so a technician can be sent immediately.[[6]](https://www.notion.so/So-it-s-just-got-one-button-And-then-we-ve-built-like-a-computer-That-s-like-a-heart-rate-monitor--276ebcf981cf8040bff7edaa9c9ca424?pvs=21)
- **Simplified water cycle** — Uses hot water if available; otherwise adapts to whatever supply is coming in. Water volume can be reduced for communities with water insecurity.[[7]](https://www.notion.so/It-will-take-hot-water-if-it-s-there-and-it-s-on-the-highest-water-cycle-amount-which-is-something-246ebcf981cf809fa48ed4cdfb411149?pvs=21)
- **Exploring removal of drain pump** — Looking at replacing with a simple drain valve to reduce failure points.

**Cycle:** 30 minutes — fill → agitate (removes mud) → drain → rinse → spin[[8]](https://www.notion.so/Red-Dust-Update-Goods-23bebcf981cf80449e6bd1da0d39b21e?pvs=21)

**Key difference from store-bought:**

Standard machines in remote communities last **1–2 years** compared to **10–15 years** nationally.[[9]](https://www.notion.so/One-Disease-Notes-19aebcf981cf8020afded107f4755214?pvs=21) The Goods machine is designed to last **5+ years** through:

- Commercial-grade base unit
- Hardened exterior protection
- Simplified single-button operation
- Remote monitoring for early fault detection
- Training local "washing machine technicians" to do repairs like "changing a fan belt on a car"[[10]](https://www.notion.so/Red-Dust-Update-Goods-23bebcf981cf80449e6bd1da0d39b21e?pvs=21)]

### Q6.4: How do the remote laundries work?
**Suggested Answer**: Multiple machines deployed together? Community-managed? How did the 60% scabies reduction get measured?

**Your Response**: [ ### 6.4 — How do the remote laundries work?

**Important clarification:** The "Remote Laundries Project" is a separate initiative run by the **Aboriginal Investment Group (AIG)** — not Goods. However, it's critical proof-of-concept that Goods references to demonstrate washing access → health outcomes.

**How the Remote Laundries Project works:**

- **Communal laundromat model** — Free, industrial-scale facility in community (not individual household machines)
- **Multiple machines deployed together** — Industrial washers and dryers in a permanent building
- **Community-managed** — Employs local staff, creating local jobs and injecting wages into the community[[1]](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/catalyst/remote-laundries)
- **Hot wash cycles (50°C+)** kill scabies mites — blankets are the "big one" as vectors for transmission[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)
- **In almost constant use** since opening

**The Barunga pilot:**

- First Remote Laundries site installed in **2019** in Barunga, NT (80km east of Katherine)
- AIG now operates **5 sites** across remote NT
- Over **60,000 wash cycles** completed
- **$750,000** in wages injected into Remote Laundries communities[[1]](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/catalyst/remote-laundries)

**How the 60% scabies reduction was measured:**

- Measured by the **local health clinic** in Barunga
- Compared scabies presentation data from **before 2019** (pre-laundry) to **2021** (post-laundry)
- Result: **60% drop in scabies cases**
- Additional outcome: **No new cases of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)** in Barunga since the laundry opened[[1]](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/catalyst/remote-laundries)

**Cost-benefit (KPMG analysis):**

- One laundry provides **$3.7 million** in net savings to government over 5 years
- Returns **$6 in healthcare savings for every $1 invested**[[1]](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/catalyst/remote-laundries)

**How Goods differs:**

Remote Laundries = communal facility model (people come to the laundry)

Goods = household-level model (indestructible machine goes into the home)

Both approaches are valid — Goods is designed for situations where families need their own machine, particularly for washing bedding, children's clothes, and managing skin health at home.]
_________________________________

### Q6.5: What's the relationship to the FRRR remote laundries program?
**Suggested Answer**: Referenced in research. Is Goods part of this program? Separate? Inspired by?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q6.5 — What's the relationship to the FRRR remote laundries program?

**Clarification: There are three separate things with similar names:**

1. **FRRR (Foundation for Rural & Regional Renewal)** — A philanthropic foundation that funds rural projects. They published research/blog content in 2022 citing the "59% of remote homes lack working washing machines" statistic.[[1]](https://frrr.org.au/blog/2022/11/10/remote-laundries-building-strong-remote-communities/)
2. **Remote Laundries Project** — Run by **Aboriginal Investment Group (AIG)** and partnered with **Heart Foundation**. This is the Barunga pilot that achieved the 60% scabies reduction. Separate organisation.[[2]](https://www.remotelaundries.org.au/)
3. **Remote Community Laundries Project** — A **new $11.4 million federal government program** (Albanese Government, announced 2025) funding up to 12 laundries across NT, QLD, SA, and WA.[[3]](https://ministers.pmc.gov.au/mccarthy/2025/grants-open-community-led-laundry-facilities-remote-first-nations-communities)

**Goods' relationship to each:**

- **FRRR** — Goods received **$50,000** from FRRR's "Backing the Future" grant program (co-funded with Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation) for the Palm Island youth-led initiative.[[4]](https://www.notion.so/FRRR-Goods-19eebcf981cf80189717e466689e4990?pvs=21) FRRR is a funder, not a program partner.
- **Remote Laundries Project (AIG)** — Goods is **not part of** this program. Goods references their 60% scabies reduction data as proof-of-concept for washing → health outcomes. Different approach: Remote Laundries = communal facilities; Goods = household machines.
- **Federal Remote Community Laundries Project** — Goods is **not part of** this federal program either, though the federal program validates the same health hardware thesis.

**Summary:**

- Goods is **separate from** all remote laundry programs
- Goods is **inspired by** the evidence from AIG's Remote Laundries Project
- Goods is **funded by** FRRR (but through a general grant, not a laundries-specific program)
- Goods takes a **different approach** — putting durable machines in individual homes rather than building communal facilities]

## Section 7: Future Products

### Q7.1: Why refrigeration next?
**Suggested Answer**: Solar-compatible for intermittent power, remote repair. What research have you done? Who's asking for it? What are the specific challenges?

**Your Response**: [**Current status:** Concept & Co-design phase[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Wiki-5b78e4df5fdc4a48964498ed469c6e29?pvs=21)

**Goal:** Repairable, modular units suited for high heat and remote power grids, with focus on water generation capabilities and durability[[2]](https://www.notion.so/1d5ebcf981cf807ba793c1a592981716?pvs=21)

---

**Who's asking for it:**

- **Groote Archipelago** — Community request form listed "Beds, Fridges, Washing Machine" as urgent needs, noting "anything we purchase is so much more expensive due to freight"[[3]](https://www.notion.so/1d9ebcf981cf81cc9030f02f65c4e05f?pvs=21)
- **Palm Island** — Carmelita and Colette discussed challenges obtaining fridges due to high freight costs[[4]](https://www.notion.so/187ebcf981cf810a8e16c48c7af19eaa?pvs=21)
- **Central Desert observation** — Out of 22 houses visited, **only one-third had working refrigerators**[[5]](https://www.notion.so/e358869bc2be4c378bac87fc8f9955c5?pvs=21)
- **Civeo partnership** — Offered end-of-life fridges for R&D[[6]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/1971528bf1033a2d)
- **Purple House** — Already provides fridges for dialysis patients, potential partner[[7]](https://www.notion.so/25cebcf981cf80bfb7a0d68b08072a99?pvs=21)

---

**The specific challenges:**

**1. Power instability**

- Pre-payment metering means power cuts off regularly when families can't afford to top up
- _"Some houses don't have fridges. If they do, they are too expensive to run"_[[8]](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/how-climate-change-turning-remote-indigenous-houses-dangerous-hot-boxes)
- Katherine NT had **56 days over 40°C** in 2019 (previous average was 6 days)[[9]](https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/indigenous-communities-facing-housing-crisis)
- Dr. Simon Quilty (Wilya Janta): _"People are being forced to choose between power and food"_[[9]](https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/indigenous-communities-facing-housing-crisis)

**2. Cost**

- Fridges cost **$1,300** in remote areas (2–3x metro prices)[[5]](https://www.notion.so/e358869bc2be4c378bac87fc8f9955c5?pvs=21)
- 43% of Aboriginal people in remote communities have gone without food in the past 12 months[[10]](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/18/disgusting-prices-and-mouldy-fruit-the-shocking-allegations-about-indigenous-australians-food-supply)

**3. Health implications**

- Can't store temperature-sensitive **medicines** (including for dialysis patients)
- Can't store **perishable food** safely — compromises nutrition
- Power outages disable vital health equipment (breathing machines, home dialysis)[[8]](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/how-climate-change-turning-remote-indigenous-houses-dangerous-hot-boxes)

---

**Research done so far:**

- **"Fridge x Power Thinking" page** — Exploring BLUETTI portable power stations (1000W, 716Wh), Dometic ePRO inverter chargers, and chest freezer to 12V conversions[[11]](https://www.notion.so/Fridge-x-Power-Thinking-20aebcf981cf8001a7a1cccf52482d86?pvs=21)
- **CFAT partnership** — Research partners developing "Bush Hardy products" for remote conditions[[12]](https://www.notion.so/17bebcf981cf80ad9e79ff30b6ed72eb?pvs=21)
- **PowerWells model** — Studying rent-to-own approaches for off-grid solar appliances[[13]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Rent-to-Own-Financing-Ideas-205ebcf981cf8090a079f6e54712d2d4?pvs=21)
- **Chest freezer conversion** — Investigating converting chest freezers to fridges (more efficient, better insulation)[[14]](https://www.notion.so/18febcf981cf80329464ffd5b2217450?pvs=21)

---

**Design requirements emerging:**

- **Solar-compatible** — Must work with intermittent power and small solar systems
- **Low power draw** — Efficient enough to run on pre-paid power budgets
- **Heat-resistant** — Must function in 40°C+ ambient temperatures
- **Locally repairable** — Modular components that can be swapped by trained community members
- **Water generation** — Exploring condensation/dehumidification capabilities (noted in Advisory Group presentation)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/1d5ebcf981cf807ba793c1a592981716?pvs=21)

---

**Why it matters:**

Unreliable refrigeration = food insecurity + medication storage failure + nutrition compromise. The health cascade is similar to beds (sleep) and washing machines (hygiene) — it's the third leg of the "health hardware" stool. ]

### Q7.2: What other products are communities asking for?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - Beyond beds, washers, fridges - what else do you hear about?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q7.2 — What other products are communities asking for?

**Documented requests beyond beds, washers, fridges:**

**1. Shower heads**

- Mentioned in Red Dust update conversation: _"Open to developing other needed products (mentioned better shower heads)"_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Red-Dust-Update-Goods-23bebcf981cf80449e6bd1da0d39b21e?pvs=21)

**3. General sentiment**

- Elder, Mt Isa: _"This isn't just about beds. We need fridges, washing machines—things that work for us, not city stuff that breaks too easy."_[[3]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21)
- The common thread is **durability + repairability** for any product

---

**What the documentation suggests but doesn't detail:**

- The Gapuwiyak request form only asks about beds, fridges, and washing machines — no "other" field captured[[4]](https://www.notion.so/2b5ebcf981cf810da468f0333fba5a7d?pvs=21)
- The 4x3x3 model deliberately limits scope to 3 products × 4 communities × 3 cycles]

## Section 8: Impact & Evidence

### Q8.1: How do you track deliveries?

**VERIFIED ANSWER** (reviewed against Notion data + v2 codebase):

---

**Current System: Notion-based Asset Register**

Goods uses a **Notion-based Asset Register** with a web app at [goods-tracker.vercel.app](https://goods-tracker.vercel.app).

**Data collected per asset:**
- **ID number** (e.g., GB0125)
- **Community** (Palm Island, Tennant Creek, Kalgoorlie, Darwin, etc.)
- **Contact/Household name** (e.g., "Dianne - double", "Norman", "Jimmy - Washer")
- **Product type** (Basket Bed, Weave Bed, ID Washing Machine)
- **Supply date**
- **Last check-in date**
- **Photo** of installation
- **Notes on condition** (e.g., "Checked in - looking good and being used")

**Current distribution (Notion dashboard):**
- Palm Island: 51 items (48.6%)
- Kalgoorlie: 22 items (21.0%)
- Tennant Creek: 20 items (19.0%)
- Unknown location: 11 items (10.5%)
- Darwin: 1 item (1.0%)

---

**Washing Machine Telemetry (ID Machines):**
- **GPS tracking** — location monitoring
- **Usage telemetry** — motor spin detection, power status
- **Internet-connected** — real-time data
- **Usage patterns** — "used every day, at least every second day"

---

**Follow-up Process:**
- **4 community trips/year** — products checked during visits
- **Check-in dates** logged in asset register
- **Empathy Ledger** — real-time protocol updates: *"If machines break more during the wet season, someone documents a solution, and that protocol goes live for others instantly."*

---

**V2 System (Next.js + Supabase) — Under Development:**

1. **QR Code Claim Flow** (`/claim/[asset_id]/`)
   - Recipients scan QR → sign in via SMS → claim item to their account
   - Creates `user_assets` record linking profile to asset

2. **My Items Dashboard** (`/my-items/`)
   - View claimed items with photos
   - Send messages (two-way with staff)
   - Request accessories: blanket, pillow, parts, checkin, pickup

3. **Bed Journey Tracking** (full lifecycle):
   - Events: `created` → `in_production` → `quality_check` → `ready` → `shipped` → `in_transit` → `delivered` → `setup` → `photo_update`
   - Each event: date, description, location, media, artisan_id

4. **Compassion Content**
   - Photos/videos of bed being made sent to recipient
   - Tracked: sent_at, viewed_at

5. **GHL CRM Sync** (server-side)
   - New claims → contact created/updated
   - Messages → appear in GHL inbox
   - Requests → trigger workflows

---

**Data Discrepancy to Verify:**
- Notion shows ~105 items total
- Marketing claims 369+ beds delivered
- Gap explanation needed: historical data not migrated? Multiple tracking systems?

**Your Response**: [ ]

### Q8.2: What stories can you tell about impact?
**Suggested Answer**: Dianne requesting 20 more beds, Linda's 4-hour laundry trips ending. What other specific stories illustrate the change?

**Your Response**: [ Q8.2: What stories can you tell about impact?

  Story 1: Ivy's First Night Off the Floor

  Palm Island, QLD

  Ivy had been sleeping on the floor for years — like many on Palm Island where the barge freight makes buying beds "very, very dear." When she received a GOODS bed, her response was immediate:

  "It's more better than laying around on the floors… It was easy to make. Yeah, it's nice."

  The change: From floor to bed. Simple words, but they capture a shift in daily dignity that most Australians take for granted.

  ---
  Story 2: Alfred's Safety

  Palm Island, QLD

  Alfred Johnson had normalized sleeping on couches and floors. After receiving a bed, he articulated something deeper than comfort:

  "Having a bed is something you need; you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed. It's different than sleeping on the couch or the ground."

  He also described the barriers that had kept him without one:

  "You can't just go down to the store and buy beds. It's a big muck-around. You have to bring them on the barge, pay for freight, and still, not everyone gets one."

  The change: Safety. Belonging. A shift from "making do" to "having what you need."

  ---
  Story 3: Dianne's Washing Machines

  Tennant Creek, NT

  Elder Dianne Stokes was one of the first to receive a GOODS washing machine. But what happened next went beyond delivery:

  "What emerged between A Curious Tractor and Traditional Owner Dianne wasn't merely a transaction of ideas, but a tapestry of mutual transformation. As Nicholas Marchesi worked alongside Dianne — crafting beds, learning language for the buttons on an 'indestructible washing machine' — we witnessed the dissolution of artificial boundaries between 'helper' and 'helped'."

  The buttons on that washing machine? Translated into local language with Dianne's guidance.

  The change: From aid recipient to co-designer. Dianne shaped the product, not just received it.

  ---
  Story 4: Jimmy's Weave Bed

  Tennant Creek, NT

  Traditional Owner Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla didn't just test a bed — he helped reimagine what a bed could be:

  "Imagine if you could weave a bed? Designing, iterating and learning with community. Thankful for Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla and his community for embracing the opportunity to reimagine Goods for the community."

  The result: a washable, repairable, community-built design that emerged from Country.

  The change: From imported solution to locally-born innovation.

  ---
  Story 5: Gloria's Rest

  Kalgoorlie, WA

  Gloria is a great-grandmother on dialysis. For her, a mattress isn't about comfort — it's about managing chronic illness:

  "The significance of staying with loved ones and being part of a supportive community for emotional and physical well-being... Emphasis on the need for a comfortable mattress for a good night's rest, the impact of a mattress on overall health."

  "Expressions of hope for better mattresses, appreciation for supportive projects, and encouragement towards better health solutions for others."

  The change: Better rest means better health management. Gloria's mattress supports her dialysis recovery.

  ---
  Story 6: Chloe's Cold Ground Emergency

  Kalgoorlie, WA — Boulder Camp

  Chloe works as an Aboriginal Homeless Fringe Support Worker. She sees the health crisis daily:

  "So many people are sleeping on the floor or on old, unsuitable mattresses. Something as simple as a good bed makes a huge difference — it improves their health, helps with mobility, and gives them dignity."

  "The immediate health risks faced by the homeless — like pneumonia from sleeping on cold, wet ground, and the long-term impacts on the elders due to exposure to harsh conditions."

  The change: Getting people off the cold ground prevents pneumonia. It's that direct.

  ---
  Story 7: The Scabies → Heart Disease Pathway

  Gapuwiyak, East Arnhem, NT

  Jessica Allardyce from Miwatj Health connected the dots clinically:

  "There is also a lot of scabies and this often leads to Rheumatic Heart Disease, so washing machines are essential to be able to clean infected clothing, bedding and towels. This is the same problem across all East Arnhem communities and homelands."

  The change: A washing machine isn't a convenience — it's cardiac prevention. Clean bedding breaks the scabies cycle before it becomes rheumatic heart disease.

  ---
  Story 8: Carmelita's Christmas

  Palm Island, QLD

  Carmelita described the gap between cultural obligation and available resources:

  "Sometimes family don't have extra mattresses. Kids sleep out with family or have to have their friends over."

  After receiving collapsible beds:

  "The community's ability to adapt and find solutions like collapsible beds for accommodating extra guests during holidays demonstrates resourcefulness and unity."

  The change: Families can now host properly during Christmas, funerals, and ceremonies — honouring cultural obligation without scrambling.

  ---
  Story 9: Five-Minute Assembly

  Mt Isa, QLD

  Mark tested the bed design and reported:

  "It was easy to make — about five minutes to assemble."

  "The bed will last a long time... Other individuals might be interested in having similar beds."

  The change: No tools, no complexity. Community members can set up beds themselves.

  ---
  Story 10: Walter's Place

  Boulder Camp, Kalgoorlie

  Walter Young has deep roots at Boulder Camp — he went to school there. When asked about sleep:

  "Discussion around the quality of sleep, comfort of the bed, and the desire for improvements in sleeping arrangements."

  "The significance of Boulder Camp as a gathering place for people from Woburton, South Australia, showcasing the value of communal spaces."

  The change: Better beds in a place that matters. Walter's comfort supports his continued connection to Country.]
    One-Line Impact Statements

  - Ivy: "From floor to bed — and it was easy to make."
  - Alfred: "From unsafe to safe. A bed changes how you feel."
  - Dianne: "From recipient to co-designer. She taught us the words."
  - Gloria: "Better rest for dialysis recovery."
  - Chloe: "Off the cold ground. Pneumonia prevented."
  - Jessica: "Clean bedding breaks the scabies → heart disease cycle."
  - Carmelita: "Families can host properly for Christmas again."

### Q8.4: What hasn't worked?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - What challenges, failures, or pivots have you faced? What did you learn?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q8.4 — What Hasn't Worked?

**⚠️ [NEEDS INPUT]** — The documentation captures technical failures but not strategic pivots or project-level challenges.

---

**What I found documented:**

**1. Product Design Challenges**

- _"Current soap dispensing for washing machines is problematic; consider a pump pack solution"_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Tennant-Car-review-July-25-224ebcf981cf80328d20c7b8974a0c9d?pvs=21)
- Washing machines initially required pressurised water, limiting deployment options[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Advisory-group-call-231ebcf981cf80118b57e93d721229e9?pvs=21)

**2. Consumer-Grade Products Failed**

- Poorer quality machines _"are often abandoned within just a few months of the purchase date"_ — concluded these models are _"inappropriate for use"_ in remote communities[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Healthy-Communities-National-Aboriginal-and-Torres-Strait-Islander-Environmental-Health-Conference--19aebcf981cf80bb8202d5769530efab?pvs=21)
- Standard domestic washers built for light use fail early in large families[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Deep-Research-Goods-1b1ebcf981cf806daeecdd2e055958ae?pvs=21)
- Identified need for commercial-grade (Speed Queen) over retail machines

**3. Failure Modes Discovered**

- Blocked pumps from dirt/lint — _"Filters quickly fill with dirt and lint... leading to blockages... preventing spinning & draining"_[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Healthy-Communities-National-Aboriginal-and-Torres-Strait-Islander-Environmental-Health-Conference--19aebcf981cf80bb8202d5769530efab?pvs=21)
- Broken suspension rods in **40%+ of Simpson machines** — prompted Electrolux to donate 200 strengthened rod sets[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Healthy-Communities-National-Aboriginal-and-Torres-Strait-Islander-Environmental-Health-Conference--19aebcf981cf80bb8202d5769530efab?pvs=21)
- Electronic boards difficult to repair without technician access

**4. Systems/Process Learnings**

- Early mistake of trying to build the "Rolls Royce" integrated system: _"I've made mistakes where I thought systems integration, everything had to integrate... you spend so much energy time on that and you lose focus of, hang on, what did we actually manage to do?"_[[5]](https://www.notion.so/215ebcf981cf809cb4c9dacca353082b?pvs=21)

---

**Input needed from you:**

- **Strategic pivots** — What big directions changed? (e.g., bed design iterations, community partnerships that didn't work out)
- **Funding or partnership challenges** — Any grants that fell through, relationships that didn't progress?
- **Deployment challenges** — Logistics failures, timing issues, community reception problems?
- **What you'd do differently** — Knowing what you know now, what would you change about the first 2 years?]

## Section 9: Business Model

### Q9.1: Is Goods on Country a charity or a business?
**Suggested Answer**: Described as "social enterprise" and "commerce with community at its heart." What's the legal structure? For-profit? Non-profit? Hybrid?

**Your Response**: [Q9.1 — Is Goods on Country a Charity or a Business? Answer: It's a hybrid — dual-entity social enterprise structure. The documented structure: A Curious Tractor operates as "a dual-entity structure: a not-for-profit paired with a mission-locked trading company, ensuring community ownership and equitable benefit-sharing."[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Our-Brand-dcc1adb97649431b903da00ee035a8bf?pvs=21) The two entities:EntityTypePurposeA Kind Tractor Ltd (ABN 50 001 350 152)Company Limited by Guarantee, registered charity with ACNC, DGR statusNot-for-profit arm — receives tax-deductible donationsA Curious TractorTrading company (Nic + Ben as equal shareholders via family trusts)Mission-locked trading arm — earns revenue, pays wages For Goods specifically: The philosophy is: "Products can be Aboriginal owned and controlled while sold commercially, with programs run through partner organisations. No need to create separate 'Goods charity' or Aboriginal-controlled entity — leverage existing strong community organisations."[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Snow-Foundation-Proposal-Q1-2026-Goods-Production-Scale-Up-7ce2d4e12ffa4c63b364622ab41f79d4?pvs=21) Currently, Goods donations are auspiced by Our Community Shed (DGR1 status) as mentioned in earlier grant documentation. Why hybrid? • Revenue side: Products are sold commercially (beds, washing machines) — this generates sustainable income • Donation side: Philanthropy funds R&D, community trips, and subsidised product deployment • Community ownership goal: Long-term transfer of manufacturing assets and enterprises to community organisations (like PICC owning their own production facility) Simple messaging version:"Goods is a social enterprise — we sell products commercially to sustain the work, but profits stay in community. Donations are tax-deductible through our charity arm. Our goal is to transfer ownership of production to First Nations organisations so we become unnecessary." ]

### Q9.2: How are products priced?
**Suggested Answer**: Beds $850-$1,500, washers $650. How do these prices compare to alternatives? What's the cost breakdown?

**Your Response**: [ Q9.2 — How Are Products Priced? ⚠️ Suggested answer needs correction — the documented prices are different. Actual documented pricing:ProductGoods CostRemote Retail AlternativeSavingsBasket Bed (double)~$350$800+ for basic mattress at local shops~$450+ID Washing Machine~$4,000$400-800 for cheap machines that last monthsLong-term value (10+ year lifespan vs 1-2 years) Bed cost breakdown (from 200 Bed Proposal):[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Project-200-Bed-Proposal-763f7062dd8e4290a7b9e935cec7eb01?pvs=21)ComponentCostBeds (materials + assembly)$350 per unitGal pipe (Weave Bed)$27 per bedProject implementation (community visits, storytelling, travel, local worker support)$5,000 per batch Why the washing machine is $4,000: The ID Washing Machine is built on a commercial-grade Speed Queen AWNA62 base, then modified with: • Hardened exterior (recycled HDPE cladding) • Simplified controls in language • Pre-water screening and softening • Drain valve instead of pump (more reliable) • Telemetry/GPS tracking • Local repairability design The unit cost is high, but the cost per use is far lower — standard machines last 1-2 years in remote conditions and cost $400-800 each time. Speed Queen commercial machines last 10+ years with proper maintenance.]

### Q9.3: Who buys the products?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - Individual consumers? Government programs? NGOs? What's the customer mix?

**Your Response**: [Based on the search results, the customer mix is well documented. Here's what I found: Q9.3 — Who Buys the Products? Key distinction: Customers (who pay) are different from beneficiaries (who use the products).[[1]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21) Primary Buyers (Current):[[1]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21)Customer TypeExamplesPhilanthropic foundationsSnow Foundation, FRRR, Vincent Fairfax, AMP Spark, TFNGovernment housing programsBulk procurement for social housing initiativesHealth organisationsRHD screening programs (Deadly Heart Trek), Indigenous health servicesCommunity cooperatives & Indigenous-run organisationsPICC, Wilya Janta, AnyinginyiLocal institutionsSchools, clinics, aged care centresCorporate partnersQIC (NAIDOC activation), Winning Group (RAP partnership) Secondary/Emerging Buyers:[[1]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21) • Socially conscious consumers — commercial retail sales (beds available for purchase via website) • Remote community members directly — "scope for them to purchase goods as the community capacity grows to care for them"[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Impact-Report-draft-Snow-Foundation-Board-September-Nov-2025-42d8737770d141bd92b89635f3ea6428?pvs=21) • Community enterprises — selling to test local markets: "there's already a few people there that are interested in like testing that enterprise's goods. So they'll start making some beds and trying to sell them"[[3]](https://www.notion.so/2f0ebcf981cf803f9ad3def7b41e6e5d?pvs=21) Future/Planned:[[1]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21) • Pacific Island nations — export/collaboration for similar remote community challenges • Impact investors • Sustainability-focused brands — licensing/partnership opportunities Current reality (to date): Most products have been philanthropically funded and deployed free or subsidised to communities. The transition to commercial sales (community members and institutions paying) is in early stages, with the goal being community-owned enterprises generating independent income. "Philanthropy is a stepping-stone; long-term goal is community-owned enterprises generating independent income."[[1]](https://www.notion.so/AMP-Tomorrow-Makers-submission-Final-18eebcf981cf8040a4b1ff9a532779cd?pvs=21) Input needed: • What's the actual percentage split to date? (e.g., 90% grant-funded, 10% direct purchase?) • Any government contracts signed or in pipeline? • Retail sales volume so far via website? ]
_________________________________

### Q9.4: How does sponsorship work?
**Suggested Answer**: "Sponsor a bed" option on site. How does matching work? Who receives sponsored beds? How are recipients selected?

**Your Response**: [ **Current funding → recipient pathway:**

**Funding sources:**

Grants and donations flow through philanthropic partners — Snow Foundation, AMP Spark, Vincent Fairfax, TFN crowdfunding events, corporate giving (QIC staff giving).[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21) Donations are tax-deductible through Our Community Shed (DGR1 auspice).

**How recipients are selected:**

Recipients are identified through **local community triage**, not centrally by ACT. For example, _"In Utopia homelands, 60 Basket Beds were installed through local triage and build-alongs"_ with Oonchiumpa connectors doing the coordination.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Impact-Report-draft-Snow-Foundation-Board-September-Nov-2025-42d8737770d141bd92b89635f3ea6428?pvs=21)

The process works like this:

- Community partners (Oonchiumpa, PICC, health organisations, local connectors) identify households in need
- Requests come through relationships, word of mouth, and the Goods Interest Register form[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Interest-Register-187ebcf981cf8138bbc0d4d71a2f7909?pvs=21)
- Local builds happen with families, ensuring fit-for-home solutions

**Corporate activations:**

QIC proposed a NAIDOC Week activation where _"employees assemble and distribute community-designed beds"_[[4]](https://www.notion.so/207ebcf981cf804ebcd9e5fa0497c7f9?pvs=21) — this is team-building + philanthropy combined, not individual sponsorship.

---

**Questions for you to clarify:**

- Is there a "sponsor a bed" feature on the website, or is this planned?
- If someone donates $350, are they matched to a specific recipient (with consent)?
- Do sponsors receive updates or photos from "their" bed recipient?
- Is there any matching or multiplier from larger funders (e.g., Snow matches individual donations)?

---

**If you want to build this model, here's a simple framework:**

_"Sponsor a Bed"_ → $350 donation via Our Community Shed (DGR1) → Funds pooled into next community deployment batch → Community partners triage and select recipients → Bed built with family on-country → Donor receives anonymised impact update (photo with consent, community name, brief story)

This keeps it **community-controlled** (no outsiders choosing who gets beds) while giving sponsors **meaningful connection** to impact.]
_________________________________

### Q9.5: What does enterprise licensing look like?
**Suggested Answer**: Communities license the model, keep 100% of local profits, receive training and support. Has any community done this? What would it cost them?

**Your Response**: [### Q9.5 — What Does Enterprise Licensing Look Like?

**⚠️ [PARTIAL — MODEL IN DEVELOPMENT]** — The vision is well-documented, but this isn't a traditional "licensing" model with set fees. It's closer to a **partnership + capacity transfer** approach.

---

**The model:**

The goal is to _"transfer manufacturing and enterprise ownership back to the community"_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Wiki-5b78e4df5fdc4a48964498ed469c6e29?pvs=21) — not license a product, but hand over the whole capability. Communities don't pay licensing fees; they receive:

- **Training programs** — Local people trained as "bed mechanics" and "washing machine technicians"
- **Manufacturing capability** — Production processes documented and transferred
- **Local maintenance** — Skills to repair and maintain, not just assemble
- **Revenue stays local** — Community keeps 100% of local profits from products they make and sell[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snowies-Snow-Entrepreneurs-Fellows-205ebcf981cf80c0b8c4c062d69b9e93?pvs=21)

---

**Has any community done this?**

Not yet fully, but two are actively working toward it:

- **Palm Island (PICC)** — Target: Men's Sheds control bed production by 2026 via SEFA-backed cooperative model[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Project-essay-186ebcf981cf81d6b323ea6ca3fde862?pvs=21)
- **Oonchiumpa (Utopia homelands)** — Testing enterprise model, _"interested in like testing that enterprise's goods. So they'll start making some beds and trying to sell them"_[[4]](https://www.notion.so/2f0ebcf981cf803f9ad3def7b41e6e5d?pvs=21)

The 2026 goal: _"A community co-op in 1 location (e.g., PICC or Oonchiumpa) is running it 3 days/week without ACT on site. We've trained 5+ community members in production, and they're training others."_[[5]](https://www.notion.so/ACT-2026-Synergetic-Harvest-Plan-23230ee41da14eaca3dcdf73565fc95a?pvs=21)

---

**What would it cost them?**

**Not documented.** The model isn't structured around licensing fees — it's about co-investment and capability transfer. Communities contribute:

- **Time and people** — Training participants, workshop space
- **Relationships** — Local distribution, community triage of who needs products
- **Possibly co-investment** — _"Direct product sales with community co-investment: Working with communities to develop appropriate payment models that respect local economic conditions and cultural practices"_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-Snowies-Snow-Entrepreneurs-Fellows-205ebcf981cf80c0b8c4c062d69b9e93?pvs=21)

---

**Input needed:**

- Is there a set cost or fee structure for communities wanting to license/adopt?
- What's the minimum commitment (e.g., training hours, production days/week)?
- Does ACT provide startup equipment (e.g., CNC router, press) or do communities fund that?

---

**Suggested reframe for messaging:**

Rather than "enterprise licensing," consider framing as **"community production partnerships"** — it's not a franchise model where communities pay to use your brand. It's capacity building toward full handover.

_"We don't license — we transfer. Communities receive full training, manufacturing capability, and documentation. They keep 100% of what they make and sell. Our goal is to become unnecessary."_ ]

## Section 10: Vision & Future

### Q10.1: Where do you want Goods to be in 5 years?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT]

**Your Response**: [### Q10.1 — Where Do You Want Goods to Be in 5 Years?

**Vision Statement:**

_"To revolutionise the creation and lifecycle of essential household goods through community-led design and local resource utilisation, creating a sustainable model where First Nations communities own, design, and benefit from the products they use."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)

---

**In Nic's words (from FRRR application):**

_"In five years time, our dream is to have the best products in the world made by and with the communities themselves. We want to not be seeing our washing machines ending up in landfill. We don't want to be seeing our fridges empty and not impacting the people that are purchasing them. Most importantly, we want to see people having amazing nights on beds that are appropriate for the communities."_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/FRRR-Goods-19eebcf981cf80189717e466689e4990?pvs=21)

---

**What success looks like in 2030:**

**1. Community-owned manufacturing**

- Self-sufficient in producing and maintaining essential household goods
- Free from dependency on external suppliers and wasteful consumption cycles
- Leaders in sustainable product design and waste reduction
- Strengthened by local ownership and economic opportunities

**Suggested draft answer:**

_"In five years, we want to have made ourselves unnecessary. The vision is simple: community-owned factories in places like Palm Island and Tennant Creek, run by local people who designed the products, built the machines, and trained the next generation. Our beds, washers, and fridges become the most trusted items in remote Australia — not because we made them, but because communities did. Every design is open-source. Every dollar of profit stays local. And ACT? We're just a phone call away if they need us — but they probably won't."_ ]

---

**3. Economic impact** _(Are people employed and earning?)_

- Jobs created in community
- Income levels of program participants vs baseline
- Goods covers 60% of ACT wages from margin by Q4 2026[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-c09109eb81f44cd2b45c4b73ad7061fd?pvs=21)

---

**6. Systemic change** _(Is the model spreading?)_

- Number of other communities replicating the model
- Changes in local or regional policies supporting sustainable practices[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Purpose-meeting-Form-6ad29fef950f4fb8a890fcd7a4c524ae?pvs=21)
- Academic or policy papers published about the project's model
- Open-source designs adopted by others

---

**Suggested draft answer:**

_"Success isn't beds in every community — it's beds made BY every community. Here's what we're measuring:_

_Product: Our goods are the most requested, most repaired, least landfilled items in remote Australia._

_People: 30+ community members trained as manufacturers and repair technicians. Jobs that stay._

_Health: Measurable reductions in scabies, skin infections, and poor sleep — tracked with local health services._

_Ownership: At least two communities running production without us. We become unnecessary._

_System: Open-source designs adopted by others. Policy recognises community-led manufacturing as a legitimate pathway._

_The ultimate success? When someone asks 'Who makes these?' and the answer is 'We do.'"_]

### Q10.3: What's the biggest obstacle right now?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT]

**Your Response**: [### Q10.3 — What's the Biggest Obstacle Right Now?

**The core tension: Demand far exceeds capacity.**

_"The challenge is that community demand far exceeds our current capacity."_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-StreetSmart-x-5500-240ebcf981cf8031abe0f4826c21516d?pvs=21)

_"Here's our running count for 2025... we're carrying 36 projects with 2 humans."_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/ACT-Energy-Ledger-The-Running-Count-9891afce4925457bb56828ce701025e5?pvs=21)

---

**The obstacle stack:**

**1. Capacity vs Demand**

- Communities are requesting hundreds of beds and machines (Groote Archipelago alone requested 500 beds + 300 washers)[[3]](https://www.notion.so/1d9ebcf981cf81cc9030f02f65c4e05f?pvs=21)
- Palm Island requested 100 additional beds after initial trials
- Two founders running everything

**2. Funding Gap**

- Total project budget estimated at **$450K–$600K/year**
- Confirmed funding ~$265K
- Gap areas:[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-StreetSmart-x-5500-240ebcf981cf8031abe0f4826c21516d?pvs=21)
    - Prototyping & testing: $160K (300 goods)
    - Workshops & community engagement: $120K (12 trips)
    - Capacity building: $60K
    - On-country production facility: $210K

**3. Manufacturing Infrastructure**

- _"Obstacles: Manufacturing space logistics, finding right community partners, ensuring quality matches or exceeds traditional products, capital requirements for equipment"_[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-revenue-reaches-300K-with-20-community-jobs-created-2a3d632cc0f44364a13c4911e25dd37b?pvs=21)

**4. Logistics & Distance**

- Shipping to remote communities is expensive and complex
- _"Shipping and transportation expenses... a significant barrier due to the location's remoteness"_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-x-StreetSmart-x-5500-240ebcf981cf8031abe0f4826c21516d?pvs=21)

**5. Scale vs Soul Risk**

- _"Scale vs Community Leadership: Risk of losing community-led approach during rapid growth"_[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Snowies-application-Snow-Financial-Reports-259ebcf981cf80789d70e7d5bf2c311f?pvs=21)
- Every community requires deep relationship building — can't be rushed

---

**What they've identified as mitigations:**

- Diversified funding streams (Snow, AMP, TFN, Centrecorp, FRRR, corporate partners)
- Transfer manufacturing to communities so they can scale locally
- Open-source designs so others can replicate without ACT
- Community co-investment models to share costs

---

**Suggested draft answer:**

_"The biggest obstacle is simple: people want more than we can build. We're two people running 36 projects, and communities are requesting beds and machines faster than we can deliver them._

_The gap isn't just funding — though we need another $200K–$300K to meet current demand. It's also infrastructure: we don't yet have community-owned manufacturing facilities running. And it's logistics: getting a bed to Gapuwiyak costs almost as much as making it._

_The real tension? We could 'scale' by becoming a bigger organisation. But that's the opposite of our model. Our job is to transfer capacity, not build an empire. So the obstacle isn't 'how do we grow?' — it's 'how do we help communities grow so they don't need us?'_

_Right now, that transfer is slower than the need. That's the gap we're working to close."_ ]

---

**2. PEOPLE**

- **Manufacturing partners** willing to co-develop durable, repairable products (not just donate stock)
- **Researchers** to help build robust evaluation frameworks (UQ conversations underway)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/QIC-Partnership-Introduction-The-Goods-Project-1d7ebcf981cf80a6b258cf9fb6de827f?pvs=21)
- **Local workers** — training young people as "bed mechanics" and "washing machine technicians"
- **Volunteers** for corporate build days (QIC NAIDOC model)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/QIC-Partnership-Introduction-The-Goods-Project-1d7ebcf981cf80a6b258cf9fb6de827f?pvs=21)

---

**3. CONNECTIONS**

- **Health services** who see the housing-health link (like Anyinginyi, Purple House, NT Healthy Homes)[[3]](https://mail.notion.so/inbox/19bc438739db026f)
- **Remote retailers** who could stock or distribute Goods products
- **Policy makers** in housing and health who understand environmental health hardware
- **Other foundations** aligned with RHD, First Nations health, or circular economy

---

**4. EQUIPMENT & IN-KIND**

- Washing machines for testing (commercial-grade Speed Queen or similar)
- Fridge R&D partners
- Shipping and logistics support (barge, freight)
- Manufacturing equipment for on-country production (mobile trailers, presses)

---

**5. POLICY (Longer-term)**

- Recognition that environmental health hardware (beds, washers, fridges) is health infrastructure
- Procurement pathways for community-made products
- Support for community-owned social enterprises

---

**Suggested draft answer:**

_"Four things:_

_First, funding. We need another $200K–$300K this year to meet the demand we're already seeing. Communities are asking for hundreds of beds and machines — we can only deliver tens._

_Second, partners — not donors. We need manufacturers who'll co-develop products with us, not just give us their old stock. Researchers who'll help us prove what works. Health services who see the connection between a washing machine and rheumatic heart disease._

_Third, connections. If you know someone in housing policy, remote retail, or First Nations health who should know about this — introduce us._

_Fourth, patience. This isn't a quick win. We're building something that communities will own and run. That takes time, trust, and showing up. If you're looking for a logo on a press release, we're not the right fit. If you're looking to be part of something that lasts — we'd love to talk."_ ]

## Section 11: Messaging Check

### Q11.1: Is "waste-to-wealth" the right framing?
**Suggested Answer**: Current tagline is "Waste-to-wealth manufacturing with community ownership." Does this capture it? Is waste-to-wealth the lead message or community ownership?

**Your Response**: [### Q11.1 — Is "Waste-to-Wealth" the Right Framing?

**Short answer:** Probably not as the _lead_ message. It's a method, not a purpose.

---

### How Goods is currently framed in different contexts:

- **Strategic Pillar:** _"Waste-to-wealth manufacturing with community ownership"_[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Circular-Economy-Community-Designed-Goods-2d6ebcf981cf81559a74cbae0229717d?pvs=21)
- **Mission statement:** _"Transferring ownership of production and profits to First Nations communities"_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)
- **Public blurb:** _"Community-owned initiative... designed to transfer back to community owners"_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)
- **Advocacy Brief:** _"Durable, Repairable, Culturally Designed Household Goods"_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)
- **Wiki:** _"Circular economy where communities own the production"_[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-Wiki-5b78e4df5fdc4a48964498ed469c6e29?pvs=21)
- **TFN Pitch:** _"Goods that heal and are healed by the community"_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)
- **Origin story:** Health outcomes — Dr. Bo Reményi, RHD prevention[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)

---

### The problem with "waste-to-wealth" as lead:

1. **It centres the material, not the people.** The word "waste" carries negative connotations — communities don't want to be associated with garbage.
2. **It's a method, not a purpose.** Using local waste is _how_ you do it. It's not _why_ it matters.
3. **It doesn't land emotionally.** When Dianne named the washing machine "Pakkimjalki Kari" (wash our clothes), she didn't name it "Recycled Plastic Washer."
4. **It may not even be accurate long-term.** The current beds use baskets and foam — not recycled plastic. The vision includes recycled HDPE, but that's future-state.

---

### What actually resonates (from community and funder feedback):

- **Health and dignity** — _"Something as simple as a good bed makes a huge difference"_[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-product-details-22bebcf981cf80299b83d71150ec0d62?pvs=21)
- **Community ownership** — _"We don't just deliver goods, we're building capacity"_[[5]](https://www.notion.so/TFN-pitch-practice-meeting-255ebcf981cf808c98f1de1367738e01?pvs=21)
- **Products that work** — _"Toyota Troopy of household goods"_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)
- **Healing framing** — _"Goods that heal and are healed by the community"_[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Goods-177ebcf981cf805fb111f407079f9794?pvs=21)

---

### Suggested reframe:

**Lead with:** Community ownership + health/dignity impact

**Secondary:** Circular economy / local production (the how)

**Tertiary:** Waste-to-value (one input, not the identity)

---

### Options to consider:

**Current:** _"Waste-to-wealth manufacturing with community ownership"_

**Alternatives:**

- _"Community-owned goods that heal"_
- _"Essential goods built with communities, for communities"_
- _"Goods that heal and are healed by the community"_
- _"Health hardware for remote communities — owned by community"_

---

### My take:

_"Goods that heal and are healed by the community"_ is the strongest line you already have. It captures:

- Health impact (heal)
- Circular economy (healed by)
- Community ownership (by the community)

Use "waste-to-wealth" or "circular economy" as a supporting proof point, not the headline. ]
_________________________________

### Q11.2: Do you like "Essential goods. Community owned." as the hero?
**Suggested Answer**: Current homepage hero. Does it land? What's the emotional response you want?

**Your Response**: [### Q11.2 — Do You Like "Essential Goods. Community Owned." as the Hero?

**Short answer:** It's clear. It's not wrong. But it's _functional_, not _emotional_.

---

### What it does well:

- **Simple and punchy** — two short phrases, easy to remember
- **Leads with clarity** — you immediately know what this is about
- **"Community owned" is the differentiator** — that's the right word to anchor on
- **No jargon** — accessible to anyone

---

### What it's missing:

- **No emotional hook** — it tells you _what_, not _why you should care_
- **No transformation** — it's static. Goods exist. Communities own them. And?
- **No health or dignity angle** — the thing that makes people lean in
- **Could describe a co-op grocery store** — it's not distinctly _this_ project
- **No sense of movement or invitation** — it doesn't ask anything of the reader

---

### What emotional response do you want?

This is the real question. Options:

- **Curiosity?** → _"What if your community made its own goods?"_
- **Urgency?** → _"150,000 people. No beds. No washers. No fridges."_
- **Hope?** → _"Goods that heal — and are healed by community."_
- **Dignity?** → _"Everyone deserves a good night's sleep."_
- **Respect?** → _"Built with communities, not for them."_

---

### Suggested alternatives:

- _"Goods that heal."_ (short, emotional, opens curiosity)
- _"Built with community. Owned by community."_ (emphasises co-design)
- _"Health hardware, community owned."_ (specific, clear)
- _"Essential goods. Designed to last. Owned by community."_ (adds durability)
- _"Goods that heal — and are healed by community."_ (poetic, circular)

---

### My take:

_"Essential goods. Community owned."_ is a safe B+. It won't confuse anyone. But it won't move anyone either.

If the goal is to stop someone scrolling and make them feel something, you need a verb or a tension. Something like:

> **"Goods that heal."**

> Built with communities. Owned by communities.

That gives you the emotional hook (heal) up top, then the proof (community ownership) below. ]
_________________________________

### Q11.3: What words should we avoid?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - "Charity"? "Helping"? What language doesn't feel right?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q11.3 — What Words Should We Avoid?

Based on the project's values (community ownership, self-determination, dignity, co-design), here's a guide:

---

### Words that undermine self-determination:

- **"Helping"** — implies one-way relationship, saviour dynamic
- **"Charity"** — positions community as recipient, not leader
- **"Giving" / "Donating to"** — same issue
- **"Beneficiaries"** — clinical, passive
- **"Recipients"** — passive, transactional
- **"The disadvantaged" / "The vulnerable"** — deficit framing
- **"Underprivileged"** — patronising
- **"Empowering"** — can imply power wasn't already there

---

### Words that centre outsiders:

- **"We provide"** — positions ACT as giver
- **"Our program"** — ownership language (prefer "the program" or "community-led program")
- **"Intervention"** — clinical, imposed from outside
- **"Service delivery"** — transactional, not relational
- **"Outreach"** — implies going TO rather than WITH

---

### Words that flatten or erase:

- **"Indigenous" as a noun** — should be adjective ("Indigenous communities" not "the Indigenous")
- **"Aboriginal" without "and Torres Strait Islander"** — when referring broadly
- **"Remote" without context** — can sound like "far away problem" rather than "home"
- **"Traditional" in ways that suggest static/past** — culture is living, not museum

---

### Words with negative connotations:

- **"Waste"** as lead message (as discussed in Q11.1) — communities don't want to be associated with garbage
- **"Problem" / "Crisis"** — deficit framing; prefer "opportunity" or specific description
- **"Struggling" / "Suffering"** — strips dignity
- **"Poverty"** — reductive; people are more than economic status
- **"Third world conditions"** — outdated and offensive

---

### Jargon to avoid (or use sparingly):

- **"Impact"** — overused, often meaningless
- **"Stakeholders"** — corporate speak
- **"Leverage"** — same
- **"Scale"** — can imply growth over depth
- **"Capacity building"** — jargon; say what you actually mean
- **"Uplift"** — patronising

---

### Preferred alternatives:

- Instead of "helping" → **"working with" / "co-designing with" / "supporting"**
- Instead of "beneficiaries" → **"community members" / "families" / people's names**
- Instead of "we provide" → **"communities lead" / "together we build"**
- Instead of "intervention" → **"partnership" / "collaboration"**
- Instead of "remote communities" → **"communities on country" / name the place**
- Instead of "the problem" → **"what we heard" / "what communities told us"**

---

### The litmus test:

Before using a word, ask: _"Would this language feel respectful if I said it directly to Richard Cassidy, Norman Frank, or Dianne Stokes?"_

If not, find another word.]
_________________________________

### Q11.4: What's the one thing you want everyone to remember?
**Suggested Answer**: [NEEDS INPUT] - If someone reads one sentence and walks away, what should stick?

**Your Response**: [ ### Q11.4 — What's the One Thing You Want Everyone to Remember?

This is the question that matters most. If someone reads one sentence and walks away, what should stick?

---

### Options based on what resonates in your documentation:

**If you lead with health:**

- _"A good bed can prevent heart disease."_
- _"Rheumatic heart disease is 100% preventable. We're starting with better beds."_

**If you lead with dignity:**

- _"Everyone deserves a good night's sleep."_
- _"Dignity lives in the details."_

**If you lead with ownership:**

- _"Communities own the factory, not just the product."_
- _"We don't deliver goods. We transfer power."_

**If you lead with co-design:**

- _"Built with communities, not for them."_
- _"The best experts on what a community needs are the people who live there."_

**If you lead with the circular/healing frame:**

- _"Goods that heal — and are healed by community."_

**If you lead with durability:**

- _"The Toyota Troopy of household goods."_

**If you lead with the exit:**

- _"Our job is to become unnecessary."_

**If you lead with the origin question:**

- _"What if we built goods that actually worked out here?"_

---

### My instinct:

The most memorable lines have **tension or surprise**:

- _"A good bed can prevent heart disease."_ — unexpected, makes you stop
- _"Our job is to become unnecessary."_ — flips the NGO script
- _"Built with communities, not for them."_ — simple reframe

The most _beautiful_ line is:

- _"Goods that heal — and are healed by community."_

The most _universal_ line is:

- _"Everyone deserves a good night's sleep."_

---

### What's the test?

Ask yourself: **If someone who's never heard of Goods repeats this to a friend, does it spark curiosity?**

- "They make beds for remote communities" — forgettable
- "They're building factories that communities will own" — interesting
- "A good bed can prevent heart disease" — wait, what?]
