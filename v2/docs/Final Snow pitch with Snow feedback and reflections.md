Hey Nic, (and Ben)

Thanks for sending this!

It’s an excellent first draft.

It’s very close to being able to share and discuss with our internal First Nations team and then share with Georgie, so ignore my timing I said the other day, we’ll go with as soon as we can consider in the next few weeks.

**Next steps/ refinements:**

- I’ll get you to pop the document into a separate attachment for ease of sharing.
- Please to take out the reference to the Deadly Heart Trek – include the Do No harm principle elsewhere, think the others are covered – it’s something our team has been talking about a bit this week for a range of things, that and dynamic consent.
- Please flesh out the risks a bit more (think about concerns that have been raised to date by us – waste, demand for the plant, payment first, key learnings?) and mitigations – I know you are factoring these all the time but let’s spell them out more as I have a couple of ideas brewing.

And further funding wise – lets check in about Minderoo? Have we discussed? Would you consider?

Also quick run though AI again – assuming have you looked at: 

**![🧠](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f9e0/72.png)** **Social Enterprise & Innovation Funders (Australia)**

**Social Enterprise Development Initiative (SEDI)** – an Australian Government initiative providing grants and support to grow social enterprises’ impact, including funding and capability building to scale business models that deliver social benefit and employment outcomes.

**Social Enterprise Loan Fund (SELF)** & supporting channels – provide flexible loan finance to help social enterprises grow, including creating jobs and improving community impact (via state/sector programs).

**Australian Communities Foundation – Impact Fund** – collective giving platform that supports bold solutions to big issues; can be a route to pooling co‑investment into innovative, community‑led projects.

---

**![💡](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f4a1/72.png)** **Indigenous Economic & Community Funding**

**Future Fund (ABC Foundation Ltd)** – strengthens Indigenous communities through on‑country economic empowerment and regional impact grants; suitable for early-stage enterprise development and community‑aligned economic models.

**First Nations Business Acceleration & Workforce Grants** – state/territory programs (e.g., Queensland First Nations Business Acceleration Program) fund scaling and skill development for Indigenous businesses and workforce pathways.

**Northern Territory Aboriginal Investment & NTRAI (Government)** – supports business grants, capacity and remote community investment, potentially aligning with on‑Country manufacture and enterprise.

---

**![📈](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f4c8/72.png)** **Other Innovation & Impact Investors**

**Giant Leap** – a VC fund in Australia investing in impact start‑ups that blend social/environmental benefits with scalable models — could be relevant if moving toward scalable social enterprise.

**Circular economy funds (e.g., Planet Ark & Boston Global’s Circular Future Fund)** – targeting waste reduction and circular innovation; while large and emerging, they represent broader sector interest in sustainable solutions and could be a co‑investment conversation.

**Local Government Social Enterprise Growth Funds** (e.g., Banyule Social Enterprise Growth Fund) – local council‑linked funding that supports scaling of social enterprise and job creation tied to place‑based innovation.

Good to check back in next week. I will try and catch Maree on Tuesday or Wed.

Still reasonably open meeting wise next week, so let me know or send me an invite and I will suggest an alt time if I cant…

Have a fantastic weekend and safe trip.

Exciting times!!

Sal.

**Subject:** Re: DRAFT Snow Foundation Principles

Hey Sally, Ashley and Maree,

Wonderful to connect yesterday (you were there in spirit Maree!) So thankful as always for your passion, support, care and kindness in this project. It is such a pleasure to be working together. Thanks for sharing these principles - we are keen to keep using them as a guidepost and reference to build and grow from. 

I have had a pass at a first draft proposal for this Q1 investment into Goods. We are trying to see if we can build some models where we use AI to keep us honest with how we are performing against our priorities so I passed them through it. Would love get your ideas and feedback.

Simply. 1. 100 more beds $60k 2. $60k to put into to production facility and to start operationalising in NT 3. (Not in current proposal $60k) for Ben and my time for 6 months on this project

Ben and I are together next week building beds so let us know if it works to catch up again.

Thanks again for this opportunity.

NM

A Curious Tractor requests **$120,000** from the Snow Foundation to scale production of on-country Goods and accelerate deployment of beds across remote Australian communities. This investment will fund **100 beds for immediate deployment** ($60,000) and **establish critical production infrastructure** ($60,000) to enable community-based manufacturing and reduce reliance on imported, disposable furniture that ends up in landfill.

This proposal responds to **200-350 bed requests** from communities and health organisations, and positions ACT to move toward financial sustainability through a social enterprise model while maintaining deep co-design partnerships with First Nations communities.

---

### Project Vision: The Big Hairy Audacious Goal

**Our ambition is bold:** Make Goods beds as ubiquitous in remote Australian communities as a troop carrier or an Akubra hat.

We envision a future where:

**1. Product ubiquity** — Visit any remote community in Australia and you'll see a Goods bed, either in use or available for purchase. It becomes the product of first choice, naturally displacing inferior alternatives.

**2. Environmental impact** — By creating a highly desirable product that people _want_, we slow the flood of cheap, disposable furniture into communities. When one Alice Springs provider sells **$3 million of washing machines annually**into communities — most ending up in dumps — we see the scale of the problem. Our solution is to introduce a "virus" of better products that people choose first, naturally reducing demand for disposable alternatives.

**Evidence of demand:**

- **Diane Stokes** received one bed and within two weeks requested 20 more, offering to fund funding herself
- **Norm Frank** called requesting three beds in maroon after his daughter tried them
- **Utopian homelands** want beds for every child (~$150,000 worth)
- **Homeland Schools Company** requesting 65 beds for kids across Maningrida communities
- **Four health organisations** have reached out following last year's forum, including Healthy Homes coordinators and OT workers

---

### Funding Request Breakdown

#### **Total Request: $120,000**

**1. Immediate Bed Deployment: $60,000**

- 100 beds @ $600 per bed
- Current production cost: $550-650 per bed
- Addresses urgent requests from health organisations and communities
- Expands field testing sample size from 15-20 beds to enable confident scaling decisions

**2. On-Country Production Plant Infrastructure: $60,000**

- Completes containerised production facility (current investment: ~$100,000 from TFN and ACT)
- Enables community-based manufacturing creating local jobs
- Facility capabilities:

- Shred plastic waste
- Create pellets and press sheets
- Computer-controlled router to cut bed components
- Capacity: ~30 beds per week when deployed for 2 months
- Each bed uses ~25kg of plastic waste (fits in 25L tub)

**Production model:** One container with shredder fills 200 tubs with processed plastic; production container arrives to build 200 beds from that plastic.

**Future capability:** Same facility will produce washing machines and fridges using different molds and cut files.

---

### Deliverables

#### **Immediate (Q1 2026):**

- 100 stretch beds delivered to requesting communities and health organisations
- Production facility operational and ready for community deployment
- Deployment plan for first community production run (likely Alice Springs with Oonchiumpa Bloomfield partnership)
- Field testing feedback from expanded bed deployment informing V4 iterations

#### **Medium-term (2026):**

- Community-based production runs in Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine, and Darwin circuit
- Partnership agreements established with host organisations (co created with Snow best practice framework )
- Job creation in communities through plastic collection, shredding, and bed assembly
- Demonstrated pathway to financial sustainability through product sales

---

### Impact and Outcomes

#### **Primary Outcomes:**

**Environmental**

- Reduce mattresses and washing machines in remote community landfill
- Create circular economy using plastic waste from communities
- Each bed diverts 25kg of plastic from landfill

**Health and Housing**

- Durable, cleanable beds that work inside and outside
- Address Healthy Homes priorities identified by health organisations
- Support families and children in homeland and community settings

**Economic and Social**

- Local job creation through plastic collection and bed production
- Skills development in manufacturing and materials processing
- Community ownership of production assets
- Pathway to financial independence reducing reliance on philanthropy

---

### Partnership and Co-Design Approach

#### Oonchiumpa **Bloomfield Family Partnership**

ACT has invested heavily in deep cultural consultation with the Oonchiumpa Bloomfield family in Tennant Creek:

- Paid top rates for cultural consultation and labor (comparable to university research rates)
- Building 5 washing machines together next week (late January 2026)
- Planning to host containerised production plant in Alice Springs
- Developing tiered payment structures: cultural consultation, program delivery, and workforce utilisation at different appropriate rates

**Next steps in partnership formalisation:**

- ACT is open to formalising agreements if foundation requires
- Committed to working together to create agreement template that can be replicated for other organisations
- Opportunity to establish best practice co-design standards in collaboration with Snow Foundation

#### **Other Partnership Models Under Development:**

**Orange Sky-inspired model:** Build container facilities that local organisations staff and operate

**Potential partners:**

- Red Dust Robotics (young fella teaching kids 3D printing and robotics)
- Deadly Science
- Centre of Appropriate Technology
- NPY Women's Council (Angela Lynch) — "always looking for beds"
- Tennant Creek Community Shed (interested in hosting shredding and plastic collection)
- Mayor Sid in Tennant Creek (exploring night patrol involvement in plastic collection)

**Philosophy:** Products can be Aboriginal owned and controlled while sold commercially, with programs run through partner organisations. No need to create separate "Goods charity" or Aboriginal-controlled entity — leverage existing strong community organisations.

---

### Production Facility: Asset Value and Monetisation

The production facility is **not a sunk cost — it's a impact asset.**

**Evidence of commercial interest:**

- Palm Island Community Company saw video and said "we'll buy it"
- Communities might pay ~$5,000/week to host facility, creating local jobs while producing products
- QIC wants to build 50 beds with staff for NAIDOC week

**Social enterprise pathway:**

- Queensland has large social impact fund with limited recipients
- Snow Foundation has offered access to social impact loans
- Model: Use philanthropy to build production plant, then loan or rent to communities creating revenue for reinvestment
- If ACT could build 1,000 beds with stock on hand and sell them, this creates revenue stream for program reinvestment

**Current challenge:** Product sales generate no margin — funds come in, products go out. This investment helps shift toward sustainable model.

---

### Risk Management and Testing Strategy

ACT is taking a **measured approach to scale:**

**Current status:** 15-20 stretch beds deployed = ~8 families (insufficient sample size)

**Target before major scale-up:** Deploy a few hundred beds for robust feedback before scaling to 5,000+ units

**Active testing:**

- One bed has been outside at the farm for 6 weeks, exposed to rain and sun, testing durability
- Gathering feedback from multiple community contexts (homelands, town, health organisations)

**Known challenges still to solve:**

- Production cost reduction needed (currently $550-650, targeting lower)

**Decision point:** Centre Corp Foundation meeting on 30 January will review stretch bed for potential Utopian homelands funding (150K request for beds for every child)

---

### Timeline

**Late January 2026:**

- Nic travels to Alice Springs and Tennant Creek
- Build 5 washing machines with Bloomfield family
- Deliver beds and gather feedback
- Discuss production facility hosting and payment tiers
- Finalise co-design agreement approach

**Q1 2026 (with Snow Foundation funding):**

- Produce and deploy 100 beds to requesting communities
- Complete production facility infrastructure
- Establish first community production site
- Formalise partnership agreements
- Complete any outstanding reporting from previous Snow Foundation commitment

**Q2-Q4 2026:**

- Circuit production runs across NT communities
- Expand to washing machine and fridge production using same infrastructure
- Build toward 1,000-bed inventory for commercial sales
- Explore social impact loan for working capital

---

### Alignment with Snow Foundation First Nations Principles

#### **1. First Nations Leadership & Empowerment**

**✓ First Nations-led partnerships:** Working directly with Oonchiumpa Bloomfield family who lead design, production planning and cultural protocols

**✓ Paying Elders/cultural advisors:** Invested heavily in 2024-25 paying top rates for cultural consultation (comparable to university research rates ~$3,800/day)

**✓ Shared decision-making:** Developing tiered payment structures and formalising agreements; Bloomfields asked Nic and Ben to help plan next homestead iteration (~$100K project), demonstrating reciprocal relationship

**✓ Community ownership:** Products are Aboriginal owned and controlled; exploring models where communities own production assets and generate revenue

---

#### **2. Early Partnership & Co-Design**

**✓ Engaged with questions, not solutions:** Product evolved through iterative feedback from Norm Frank, Diane Stokes, and multiple community members testing beds in real-world conditions

**✓ Resourced time, travel and cultural load:** Paid for Bloomfield family time, travel to farm, cultural consultation; acknowledged in meeting that "we asked for no favours"

**✓ Iterative milestones:** Currently in testing phase (15-20 beds with ~8 families); targeting few hundred beds for robust feedback before scaling to 5,000+ units

**✓ Next steps:** Co-creating agreement template with Snow Foundation that can be replicated for other organisations; open to formalising governance structures as foundation requires

---

#### **3. Place-Based, On-Country Delivery**

**✓ Northern Territory focus:** Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine, Darwin circuit production model; utopian homelands; Maningrida communities

**✓ Community-chosen venues:** Planning production in community sheds (Tennant Creek Community Shed interested in hosting); under community control, not imposed infrastructure

**✓ Locally tailored:** Each bed uses 25kg of local plastic waste; production model adapts to community needs (200 tubs filled locally, then production container arrives)

**✓ Snow priority place alignment:** Northern Territory is one of Snow's four priority places

---

#### **4. Genuine Collaboration & Partnerships**

**✓ Clear roles and capability building:** Orange Sky-inspired model where ACT builds container facilities, local organisations staff and operate them

**✓ Partner capability investment:** Working with potential partners (Red Dust Robotics, Deadly Science, Centre of Appropriate Technology, NPY Women's Council, Tennant Creek Community Shed, Mayor Sid/night patrols)

**✓ Reciprocity clause:** Products address community-chosen priorities (beds, washing machines, fridges); communities identify what they need, ACT responds

**✓ Returning knowledge to community:** All product IP and production knowledge transfers to communities; exploring models where Palm Island Community Company and others can purchase/own production plants

**✓ Avoiding duplication:** Partnering with existing strong organisations rather than creating new "Goods charity" or separate Aboriginal-controlled entity

---

#### **5. Advocacy & Policy Influence**

**✓ Community-led evidence:** Organic demand from end users (Diane, Norm, health organisations, homeland communities) demonstrates market validation

**✓ Systems change opportunity:** Addressing $3M/year washing machine dumping cycle in Alice Springs; proving alternative model where desirable products displace disposable imports

**✓ Environmental impact data:** Each bed diverts 25kg plastic from landfill; production facility creates measurable reduction in mattresses/washing machines in community dumps

**Future opportunity:** As production scales, ACT can provide community-led evidence for policy change on plastic waste, circular economy in remote communities, and procurement standards

---

#### **6. Evidence-Based & Culturally Safe Programs**

**✓ Blending evidence with cultural protocols:** Products evolved through yarning and relational feedback (not formal surveys); iterative testing respects how communities actually engage

**✓ Cultural safety in design:** Beds work inside/outside, cleanable, movable, match house colors (Norm's maroon request); respect for how families actually live

**✓ Trauma-aware approach:** No imposed solutions; no "fixing" communities with Western furniture models; instead creating products people want and choose

**✓ Workforce training:** Production model creates skills development in manufacturing, materials processing, computer-controlled routing, plastic collection and sorting

---

#### **7. Long-Term, Flexible Funding**

**✓ Multi-year vision:** Building toward 1,000-bed inventory and social enterprise model; exploring Snow Foundation's social impact loan pathway

**✓ Full cost recovery model:** Moving from zero-margin product delivery toward sustainable pricing that enables reinvestment in programs

**✓ Flexible funding lines:** This $120K request includes flexible production plant infrastructure that serves multiple purposes (beds, washing machines, fridges) and can generate revenue

**✓ Local workforce pipelines:** Production facility creates ongoing jobs in communities; ~30 beds/week over 2 months = sustained local employment

**✓ Stability for planning:** Request enables completion of production facility and 100-bed deployment, creating foundation for Q2-Q4 2026 circuit production runs

---

#### **8. Data Sovereignty & Indigenous IP**

**✓ Community control of IP:** Products co-designed with Bloomfield family; cultural knowledge and design input owned by community

**✓ Return results first to community:** Testing feedback goes to Bloomfields first; production learnings shared with partner communities before external reporting

**✓ No extractive research:** Not academic study or evaluation; practical production partnership where communities retain control

**Future commitment:** As production scales, ACT commits to Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles for any impact measurement, agreeing purpose/access/storage upfront with community partners

---

### Deadly Heart Trek Cultural Priorities Alignment

**✓ Trust and relationship building:** Nic and Ben's relationship with Bloomfields described as "far greater than any piece of paper"; two years of iterative engagement

**✓ Reciprocity:** "What footprints are we leaving?" — Leaving production assets, skills, revenue-generating capacity, not just consumable products

**✓ Do no harm:** Measured scale-up approach; testing extensively before mass production; acknowledging when things aren't ready (washing/sanitising solution still needed)

**✓ Community-led approach:** Bloomfields guide cultural protocols, payment structures, partnership models; ACT follows their lead

---

### Connection to RHD and Health Priorities

**✓ Healthy Homes connection:** Four health organisations reached out (including Healthy Homes Project Coordinator Anna Phillip); beds address housing quality and sleep health

**✓ Remote Laundry Collective:** Building washing machines next week with Bloomfields; same production plant will scale washing machine access

**✓ Practical health infrastructure:** Cleanable, durable beds and washing machines are foundational health interventions, especially relevant to RHD prevention

---

**ACT deeply admires the foundation's RHD guidelines and First Nations principles, and welcomes guidance on co-design requirements and agreement templates. This proposal represents an opportunity to co-create best practice frameworks together.**

---

### Investment Priorities (in order)

1. **More beds** — Immediate demand and field testing expansion
2. **Production facility** — Infrastructure for sustainable scale and job creation
3. **Nic and Ben's time** — R&D, partnership development, and program delivery

This $120,000 request focuses on priorities 1 and 2, positioning ACT to move toward financial sustainability that will support priority 3 through earned revenue.

---

### Context: 2024 Funding Landscape

2024 was a challenging year for philanthropy conversion. ACT's only supporters for R&D and growth (not just product purchase) were:

- Snow Foundation
- The Funding Network (~$80K for production facility, actual costs exceeded $100K)
- Centre Corp Foundation

This context has catalysed ACT's thinking about **self-determination through social enterprise** — not abandoning philanthropy, but building financial independence to control our own future while maintaining deep community partnerships.

---

We're not just building beds. We're building a new model where First Nations communities have the tools to manufacture durable, desirable products from their own waste streams, creating jobs and pride while displacing the disposable furniture cycle that fills community dumps.

The demand is there. The partnerships are strong. The production system works. This investment helps us prove it at scale.
