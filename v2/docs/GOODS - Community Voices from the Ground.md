*Essential goods for remote Australia — designed with, not for, community*

---

## Executive Summary

GOODS has spent extended time embedded in communities across remote Australia — not brief consultations, but multi-week residencies listening, learning, and participating in local protocols. This document captures the voices of **15 storytellers** across **6 communities** who have shaped and validated the GOODS approach.

What emerges is consistent: essential goods like beds, mattresses, washing machines, and refrigerators are critically needed but prohibitively expensive or inaccessible. The solutions must be **portable**, **washable**, **community-repairable**, and designed around how people actually live.

---

## The Communities

### Palm Island, QLD
**Bwgcolman Country** | Accessible only by boat or small plane from Townsville

Palm Island represents GOODS' deepest community engagement, with 6 storytellers contributing across multiple visits. Everything arrives on the Lucinda barge — and as residents consistently report, the freight makes essential goods unaffordable.

---

### Tennant Creek, NT
**Wumpurrarni Country** | Heart of the Barkly Region

One of the most under-resourced towns in Australia for essential goods. GOODS deployed five washing machines in partnership with Wilya Janta and Anyinginyi Health. The collaboration with Traditional Owner Dianne Stokes exemplifies the co-design approach.

---

### Kalgoorlie, WA
**Goldfields Region** | 600km east of Perth

Fourteen tribal groups converge around this region. Many people live on the fringes of town at camps like Boulder Camp. Support workers from Bega have documented urgent need for bedding solutions that address both health and dignity.

---

### Mt Isa, QLD
**Kalkadoon Country** | Far Northwest Queensland

Ongoing collaborations with community leaders have resulted in co-designed bedding solutions. Testing has confirmed durability and ease of assembly.

---

### Darwin, NT
**Partnership with Red Dust**

Wayne Glenn and the Red Dust team have provided critical context on systemic health challenges and the role of bedding in addressing root causes like rheumatic heart disease.

---

### Gapuwiyak & East Arnhem, NT
**Via Miwatj Health**

Requests received from health workers documenting the direct connection between lack of washing machines, scabies outbreaks, and rheumatic heart disease.

## The Storytellers

### Palm Island

#### Ivy
*Community Member*

Ivy speaks to the everyday reality of life without proper bedding — and the difference it makes.

> "Hardly anyone around the community has beds. When family comes to visit, people sleep on the floor."

After receiving a GOODS bed:

> "It's more better than laying around on the floors… It was easy to make. Yeah, it's nice."

**Impact**: First-hand validation that simple, functional design improves daily life.

---

#### Alfred Johnson
*Community Member*

Alfred articulates both the logistical barriers and the emotional significance of having a bed.

> "You can't just go down to the store and buy beds. It's a big muck-around. You have to bring them on the barge, pay for freight, and still, not everyone gets one."

> "Having a bed is something you need; you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed. It's different than sleeping on the couch or the ground."

Alfred also describes overcoming shame as key to community engagement:

> "The importance of overcoming shame to engage with and support community members to address needs effectively."

He describes the Christmas Cup — a community footy event that brings people together:

> "The Christmas Cup brings communities together through activities like football."

**Impact**: Connects physical comfort to safety, dignity, and community pride.

---

#### Carmelita & Colette
*Community Members*

These two women highlight the gap between family obligation and available resources.

> "Sometimes family don't have extra mattresses. Kids sleep out with family or have to have their friends over."

They emphasize the importance of bedding during gatherings:

> "The community's ability to adapt and find solutions like collapsible beds for accommodating extra guests during holidays demonstrates resourcefulness and unity."

> "Recognition of the vital role of a good night's sleep in maintaining health and well-being, despite difficulties in affording new mattresses and beds due to the cost of living."

**Impact**: Validates the need for versatile, portable solutions for cultural gatherings.

---

#### Daniel Patrick Noble
*Community Member*

Daniel provides cultural and economic context.

> "The importance of visiting family, feeling at home, and engaging with extended family members on Palm Island highlights the strong sense of community and belonging."

On economic barriers:

> "Residents face high costs of shipping goods, leading to difficulties in furnishing homes and the tendency to opt for cheaper options that may not last long."

On cultural sensitivity:

> "The significance of understanding and respecting local cultural protocols and community contexts, the importance of seeking permission and observing sensitivities in indigenous communities."

He suggests practical solutions:

> "Versatile furniture that can act as a bed and a coffee table, catering to the needs of accommodating family members and visitors."

**Impact**: Frames the work within cultural obligation and protocol.

---

#### Jason
*Long-term Palm Island Resident*

Jason speaks from extended experience with GOODS products.

> "The beds are suitable for outdoor spaces and versatile in their use."

> "Engaging with the community and supporting families requires clear communication and establishing a collaborative approach."

> "The value of traditional practices and their impact in enhancing daily experiences and promoting mobility."

His advice:

> "Try the beds for yourselves and see the benefits firsthand."

**Impact**: Validates durability and outdoor functionality — critical for how people actually use bedding.

---

### Tennant Creek

#### Dianne Stokes
*Elder & Traditional Owner*

Dianne is a pivotal figure in the GOODS story. She received one of the first washing machines deployed in Tennant Creek.

> "Hardly any people around the community have beds."

The collaboration went beyond delivery:

> "What emerged between A Curious Tractor and Traditional Owner Dianne wasn't merely a transaction of ideas, but a tapestry of mutual transformation. As Nicholas Marchesi worked alongside Dianne — crafting beds, learning language for the buttons on an 'indestructible washing machine' — we witnessed the dissolution of artificial boundaries between 'helper' and 'helped'."

**Impact**: Demonstrates co-design in action. Language adaptation for washing machine buttons shows deep engagement.

---

#### Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla
*Traditional Owner*

Jimmy worked with GOODS on the Weave Bed prototype.

> "Imagine if you could weave a bed? Designing, iterating and learning with community. Thankful for Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla and his community for embracing the opportunity to reimagine Goods for the community."

The design philosophy:

> "Washable, repairable, community-built."

**Impact**: Community-led innovation. The weave bed represents co-creation, not just delivery.

---

### Kalgoorlie

#### Gloria
*Community Elder, Dialysis Patient, Great-Grandmother*

Gloria connects mattress quality directly to health outcomes.

> "The significance of staying with loved ones and being part of a supportive community for emotional and physical well-being."

> "Emphasis on the need for a comfortable mattress for a good night's rest, the impact of a mattress on overall health."

> "Expressions of hope for better mattresses, appreciation for supportive projects, and encouragement towards better health solutions for others."

**Impact**: Links bedding to health management for chronic conditions.

---

#### Walter Young
*Boulder Camp Resident, originally from Woburton*

Walter has deep attachment to Boulder Camp and speaks to sleep quality.

> "Walter's strong attachment to Boulder Camp where he went to school, highlighting the emotional bond individuals can have with certain locations."

> "Discussion around the quality of sleep, comfort of the bed, and the desire for improvements in sleeping arrangements."

> "The significance of Boulder Camp as a gathering place for people from Woburton, South Australia, showcasing the value of communal spaces."

---

#### Chloe
*Aboriginal Homeless Fringe Support Worker, Bega*

Chloe works directly with people living rough in Boulder Camp and Ningalmy.

> "As a support worker here, I see how much proper bedding is needed in the community. So many people are sleeping on the floor or on old, unsuitable mattresses. Something as simple as a good bed makes a huge difference — it improves their health, helps with mobility, and gives them dignity."

She documents urgent health risks:

> "Highlighting the immediate health risks faced by the homeless, like pneumonia from sleeping on cold, wet ground, and the long-term impacts on the elders due to exposure to harsh conditions."

On solutions:

> "Introduction of innovative shelter solutions to address the challenges faced by homeless communities, such as getting them off the cold ground, enhancing hygiene, and portability."

**Impact**: Front-line validation of health-bedding connection.

---

#### Dena
*Social Support Manager, Bega*

Dena sees the systemic picture and the opportunity for community ownership.

> "Addressing various societal issues such as homelessness, health disparities, and struggling youth in the community."

> "Highlighting the importance of hygiene, especially post-COVID, and the need for easily washable bedding materials."

On economic empowerment:

> "Exploring the potential for community members to run a social enterprise, creating opportunities for economic empowerment."

On design:

> "Recognizing the practical benefits of raised beds for keeping people off the ground, providing storage space, and enhancing comfort for those in need."

**Impact**: Frames GOODS as potential community enterprise, not just aid.

---

### Mt Isa

#### Tracy McCartney
*Support Worker*

Tracy frames the work in terms of dignity.

> "The new mattress design is not just about comfort — it's about dignity and health. Lightweight, washable, and off the ground, it addresses real challenges people face living rough or moving between camps."

**Impact**: Dignity framing for grant applications and public communication.

---

#### Mark
*Community Member*

Mark tested the bed design and validated durability.

> "The interviewee believes the bed will last a long time, emphasizing the expectation of longevity and quality in the product."

> "It was easy to make — about five minutes to assemble."

> "Other individuals might be interested in having similar beds, hinting at potential demand."

**Impact**: User testing validation.

---

### Darwin

#### Wayne Glenn
*Red Dust Partnership*

Wayne provides systemic health context.

> "The dialogue centers around health issues in Indigenous communities, discussing systemic challenges, health programs, and the importance of addressing root causes to tackle entrenched health issues."

> "The conversation addresses the challenges of poor bedding environments in remote communities, emphasizing the need for practical, transportable, and hygienic bedding solutions as an essential element for improving living conditions."

### Gapuwiyak & East Arnhem

#### Jessica Allardyce
*Miwatj Health*

Jessica articulates the direct health pathway.

> "Essential goods are difficult to get out as everything comes on a barge and they are expensive. There is also a lot of scabies and this often leads to Rheumatic Heart Disease, so washing machines are essential to be able to clean infected clothing, bedding and towels. This is the same problem across all East Arnhem communities and homelands."

On implementation:

> "Space/buildings are limited, so unsure of a suitable location to manufacture goods. Community members would also need upskilling."

**Impact**: Clinical validation of the scabies → RHD pathway. Justifies washing machine priority.

---

### Groote Archipelago

#### Simone Grimmond
*WHSAC (submitted via Goods Request Form)*

Simone describes the island economics:

> "We are on an island — literally. Therefore anything we purchase is so much more expensive due to freight. We also do not have competitive pricing amongst the two businesses on the Eylandt so again cost is inflated."

Scale of need:

> **500 mattresses, 300 washing machines needed**

> "Resources — all required. Skills — would need to develop."

**Impact**: Quantified demand from a single community.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. The Freight Tax
Every remote community pays a "remoteness premium" that makes essential goods unaffordable:
- Palm Island: barge freight makes goods "very, very dear"
- Groote: no competitive pricing, costs inflated
- Gapuwiyak: "everything comes on a barge and they are expensive"

### 2. Health ↔ Bedding Connection
Multiple storytellers and health workers link bedding directly to health outcomes:
- **Scabies → Rheumatic Heart Disease** (Miwatj Health)
- **Cold ground → Pneumonia** (Kalgoorlie fringe camps)
- **Floor sleeping → Back problems, poor rest** (Palm Island elders)
- **Chronic disease management** (Gloria, dialysis patient)

### 3. Cultural Obligation & Family
Bedding needs spike during cultural gatherings:
- Christmas and New Year — extended family visits
- Community events — football carnivals, funerals, ceremonies
- Seasonal movement — people moving between communities

### 4. Dignity, Safety, Belonging
The emotional dimension appears consistently:
> "Having a bed is something you need; you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed." — Alfred
> "It's about dignity and health." — Tracy

### 5. Community Ownership
Multiple communities express interest in local manufacturing and enterprise:
- Tennant Creek: co-design with Traditional Owners
- Kalgoorlie: social enterprise potential (Dena)
- Groote: "Skills — would need to develop"
