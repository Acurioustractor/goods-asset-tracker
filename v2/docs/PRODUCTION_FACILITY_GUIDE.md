### Equipment Inventory

| Equipment | Make/Model | Location | What It Does |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Granulator (shredder/chipper) | Zerma | 20ft container | Grinds plastic waste into uniform flakes |
| Heat press | Custom "sandwich toaster" | 40ft container | Melts plastic flakes at 180°C into sheets |
| Hydraulic press | Red manual jack, 5000 PSI | 40ft container | Compresses melted sheets to correct thickness |
| Cooling press | Blue frame with jack | 40ft container | Cools sheets under pressure (4 sheets at a time, 2 per layer) |
| CNC router | Carbatec (on bench) | 40ft container | Cuts sheets into flat-pack bed frame parts (3-5 hrs per bed) |
| Edge router | Handheld/bench | 40ft container entrance | Smooths cut edges on finished parts |
| Dust extractor | Carbatec wall-mounted | 40ft container | Captures plastic dust during CNC operation |

## Production Process

Each Stretch Bed requires **~15kg of recycled HDPE/PP plastic waste** (21kg input accounting for waste/offcuts).

### Process Flow

```
COLLECT → SORT → SHRED → WEIGH → FILL TRAY → HEAT → PRESS → COOL → CUT → EDGE → ASSEMBLE
  1        2       3       4        5          6       6       7      8      9       10
```

---

### Step 1: Collection & Sorting

**Where:** Community collection points
**Equipment:** None — manual sorting

- Collect plastic waste: bottle caps, containers, off-cuts
- Sort strictly — **HDPE and PP only**
- **NEVER process PVC** — releases toxic chlorine gas when heated
- Remove non-plastic contaminants (metal, labels, food residue)
- Store sorted plastic in labelled bins

**Quality check:** If unsure about plastic type, check recycling number:
- 2 (HDPE) — Yes
- 5 (PP) — Yes
- 3 (PVC) — NEVER
- Everything else — No

---

### Step 2: Shredding

**Where:** 20ft container
**Equipment:** Zerma granulator
**Power:** Diesel generator (cannot run heat press at same time)

1. Start generator
2. Ensure dust extraction is running
3. Feed sorted plastic into granulator hopper — don't overload
4. Flakes collect in bin below the machine
5. Transfer flakes to labelled clear storage tubs
6. Weigh each tub and note contents

**Watch out for:**
- Oversized pieces — pre-cut anything too large for the hopper
- Foreign objects — metal will damage blades
- Noise — ear protection required in 20ft container

---

### Step 3: Tray Preparation

**Where:** Prep table, 40ft container
**Equipment:** Scales, metal trays, storage bins

1. Place metal tray on prep table
2. Weigh out **15kg** of plastic flakes (use digital scales)
3. Spread flakes evenly across the tray — no gaps, no hills
4. Ensure edges are filled — uneven loading creates weak spots in the finished sheet

**Tip from first shift:** Even distribution is the most important factor in sheet quality. Take time here.

---

### Step 4: Heating

**Where:** Heat press, 40ft container
**Equipment:** Custom "sandwich toaster" heat press
**Power:** Diesel generator (cannot run chipper at same time)

1. Switch generator power from chipper to heat press
2. Slide filled tray into heat press
3. Jack up the press so the tray is held firmly between heating elements
4. Set temperature to **180°C**
5. Heat for **2-4 hours** (check periodically for full melt)
6. **Keep ventilation running** — doors open, extractor on

**Watch out for:**
- Hot surfaces — gloves and long sleeves essential
- Fumes — maintain ventilation at all times
- Duration varies — first-timers should check frequently

---

### Step 5: Pressing

**Where:** Hydraulic press (same unit)
**Equipment:** Red hydraulic jack — 5000 PSI capacity

1. Once plastic is fully melted, jack up the press
2. Apply **5000 PSI pressure** — use the gauge to confirm
3. This compresses the melted plastic to the correct sheet thickness
4. Hold pressure while hot

**Note:** The pressure gauge (visible on the red hydraulic jack) reads up to 5000 PSI. Target even pressure across the full sheet.

---

### Step 6: Cooling

**Where:** Cooling press, 40ft container
**Equipment:** Blue frame cooling press with jack

1. Transfer hot tray from heat press to cooling press
2. Jack up to apply light, even pressure
3. **Leave to cool** — overnight is ideal
4. Cooling press has **two layers** — can hold **2 sheets per layer** (4 total at a time)
5. Once cool, release pressure and slide sheet out

**Current status:** 9 sheets completed, one in cooling press.

---

### Step 7: CNC Cutting

**Where:** CNC router bench, 40ft container
**Equipment:** Carbatec CNC router + connected laptop
**Power:** Generator

**Note:** CNC is not currently operational — contact Jimmy re: setup.

1. Secure cooled sheet on CNC bed
2. Connect dust extractor hose to CNC
3. Load cutting template on computer
4. Run cutting program
5. Machine cuts all flat-pack parts for one bed (**3-5 hours per sheet**)
6. Vacuum dust between sheets

**Output:** Each sheet produces the flat-pack frame components for one bed.

---

### Step 8: Edge Finishing

**Where:** Router station near 40ft container entrance
**Equipment:** Edge router

1. Take cut parts to router station
2. Run router along all cut edges
3. Goal: **smooth, rounded edges** — no sharp corners or burrs
4. Check all surfaces by hand

---

### Step 9: Assembly

**Where:** Assembly area, 40ft container
**Equipment:** Cut frame parts + steel poles + canvas

1. Lay out cut recycled plastic parts
2. Slot parts into frame design (no glue, no nails, no tools)
3. Insert 2x galvanised steel poles (26.9mm OD)
4. Stretch heavy-duty canvas sleeping surface over frame
5. **Weight-bearing test:** apply 200kg load to confirm
6. Package flat-pack for delivery

## Safety Protocols

### PPE Required at All Times

| Item | When |
|------|------|
| Safety gloves | Always — especially near heat press and chipper |
| Safety goggles | Always — plastic fragments during shredding and cutting |
| Dust/fume mask | During shredding, CNC cutting, and heating |
| Closed-toe shoes | Always |
| Long sleeves | Near heat press (burns from hot surfaces/plastic) |
| Ear protection | During shredder operation |

### Critical Rules

1. **No lone working** — Always have a buddy for hot processes (heating, pressing)
2. **Ventilation** — Extractor always on during operations; container doors open during heating
3. **One machine at a time** — Generator cannot power chipper and heat press simultaneously
4. **No PVC** — Never process PVC plastic (releases toxic chlorine gas)
5. **Hot surface awareness** — Trays, press, sheets are all extremely hot during/after heating
6. **Fire extinguisher** — Located in each container. Know where it is before starting
7. **First aid kit** — Located in 40ft container

2. Walk the facility — check all equipment is in expected state
3. Check diesel level in generator
4. Check PPE is available and in good condition
5. Review the day's production target
6. Start generator if needed

### During Shift

- Log what you're doing as you go (sheets started, sheets completed, issues)
- Take photos of completed sheets
- Note any equipment issues
- Track diesel usage

### End of Shift

1. Turn off all equipment
2. Secure generator
3. Close and lock both containers
4. Complete handover notes:
   - **Current status** — What's in progress (e.g. "1 sheet in cooling press")
   - **Completed** — How many sheets finished this shift
   - **Issues** — Anything broken, running low, or unusual
   - **Next shift actions** — What the next person should start with

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Uneven sheets | Flakes not spread evenly in tray | Redistribute before heating; take more time on prep |
| Sheets too thick/thin | Pressure not consistent | Check gauge — target 5000 PSI; ensure even jack |
| Bubbles in sheet | Moisture in flakes or air pockets | Pre-dry flakes; spread more evenly |
| CNC drift | Calibration off | Recalibrate; check sheet is secured flat |
| Shredder jamming | Oversized pieces or foreign objects | Clear blockage; pre-cut large items |
| Weak final product | Wrong plastic type mixed in | Check sorting — HDPE/PP only |
| Generator won't start | Low fuel, flat battery | Check diesel level; check battery connections |
| Fumes during heating | Normal (within reason) or PVC contamination | Ensure ventilation; if unusual smell, stop and check plastic source |

## Building This Into a Production System

### Recommended Approach

The shift handover and production tracking should live in a system accessible on-site, ideally from a phone or tablet. Three options in order of recommendation:

#### Option A: Notion (Current — Good for Now)

**Structure:**
```
Goods Production
├── Shift Log (Database)
│   ├── Date, Operator, Shift times
│   ├── Sheets produced, sheets cooling
│   ├── Issues, handover notes
│   └── Photos
├── Sheet Tracker (Database)
│   ├── Sheet number, weight, heat time
│   ├── Quality score, CNC status
│   ├── Status: [Prepped | Heating | Cooling | Cut | Assembled]
│   └── Photo
├── Equipment Log (Database)
│   ├── Equipment name, issue, date
│   ├── Resolution, resolved by
│   └── Maintenance due dates
├── Operations Manual (Page)
│   └── This document, embedded
└── Safety Induction (Page)
    └── Checklist for new operators
```

**Pros:** Already in use, free, works offline with app, good for docs
**Cons:** Not designed for production workflows, no barcode/QR support

#### Option B: Simple Web App (Future — When Scaling)

A lightweight progressive web app (PWA) that:
- Works offline (critical for remote communities with poor connectivity)
- Scans QR codes on sheets/beds for tracking
- Captures photos inline
- Syncs data when connection is available
- Generates shift reports automatically
- Could integrate with the existing Goods v2 site and Supabase backend

**Tech stack:** Next.js PWA + Supabase (matches existing v2 infrastructure)

This would be worth building when:
- Multiple communities are running production
- Tracking needs to scale beyond one facility
- You need real-time dashboards for funders/management

#### Option C: Hybrid — Notion Now, App Later

Start with Notion for the current single-site setup. Structure the data cleanly so it can be migrated to a custom app when needed. The Notion databases become the spec for the app's data model.
